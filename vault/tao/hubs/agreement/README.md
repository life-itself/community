# Hubs Residency Agreement

We are a mindful community seeking to create a sustainable shared space of warmth, getting stuff done, joy, creativity, generosity, acceptance and authentic connection. 

We are committed to living together in a way that cultivates wisdom, compassion and care for ourselves, each other and the world around us. In order to achieve that we embrace certain principles, such as the [Five Mindfulness Principles](https://tao.lifeitself.us/five-mindfulness-trainings/). 

## Shared Meals

*   Shared meals are an important part of the ‘glue’ that holds our community together. 
*   We share all our food, so anyone can eat anything in the kitchen unless it is clearly labelled otherwise.
*   We are expected to have supper together once a week. Days will be specified in advance and can be adjusted by residents based on consensus. 
*   We have breakfast together twice a week.
*   Shared meals are vegan/vegetarian and friendly towards people with other dietary requirements (e.g. gluten free). It is fine for people to supplement their own diet with meat or fish, but this isn’t cooked as part of the main dish.
*   We take turns to wash up after communal meals. If you cooked, you don’t have to wash up. We aim to cook a fairly large amount, ideally so that there are leftovers for people coming home late or for lunch the next day.

## Collective Responsibility

*   We take collective responsibility for the care of the Hub, and keep it tidy for each other. For example, when we finish in the kitchen, we wash up the things we have used.
*   As the communal part of the Hub will be used intensively we understand that keeping things clean and tidy, putting things away after us, washing up after us and not leaving things lying around in the main space is a priority for our well-being and harmonious ongoing relationship. The aspiration is to leave the Hub communal spaces cleaner than you found them.
*   The expectation is that everyone will do the following things each week:
    *   Cook dinner once (or twice if working in a pair)
    *   Wash up dinner once (or twice if working in a pair)
    *   Be present for the majority of Hub meetings
*   The hubresidents agree on a suitable cleaning rota, apply it, and improve it if it doesn't work well. For example, each week one person could be responsible for a deep clean of the communal spaces (kitchen, living room, bathroom, toilet, corridor) including hoovering, cleaning all surfaces in bathroom and kitchen etc.
*   Any time put into the Hub in addition to the above is freely given. For example, if some of us choose to work on the garden, spend time hosting guests, or bake a cake, we take care not to feel resentment towards anyone who is not choosing to do this, or believe that they are somehow ‘not doing their fair share’.
*   Guests who are staying for more than three days are expected to help out with the cooking, cleaning and washing up (on a pro-rata basis).
*   The Hub is quiet after 11pm and before 7am.

## Communicating & Resolving Conflicts

*   “Getting complete”, emotional “cleaning” and conflict resolution is a priority in our community.
*   We believe that unspoken resentment and unresolved disagreements cause blocked relationships that damage a community.
*   We seek to create safe spaces for each other and to learn tools such as meditation, integrity (restoration), flower watering (acknowledgement), non-violent communication and sharing to help us transform conflict into positive growth.
*   We are determined to show-up to each other and not hide from things for convenience, when we have a chance to address issues in a sufficiently safe and kind space. 
*   We do practices like [Beginning Anew](https://tao.lifeitself.us/beginning-anew/#introduction) on a regular basis (once a month/bi-monthly), or when the situation necessitates it.

## Practicalities

### Money & Shared Resources

Guests will be advised whether they are part of the shared cost of communal food or just expected to replace what they use and contribute to the food from a place of generosity. 

This applies only if the guest joins the shared communal food:

*   We share the following items which are paid for communally: cleaning supplies, washing powder, basic bathroom supplies, bills and food. We aim to live in a spirit of trust and friendship and generosity, and keep things simple, so we all pay the same amount.
*   Note that shared food excludes meals out, takeaways, and alcohol.
*   We aim to buy organic and fairtrade food, and ecological cleaning supplies where possible. We aim to purchase bulk supplies from a cooperative wholesaler such as Suma, where possible.
*   Items are paid for from each of our own finances and then the cost is reimbursed by Hubmates. We use a simple online tool to keep track of how much we owe each other. (We aim to not be more than £100 in debt to other Hubmates at any time).

### Sex & Relationships

*   Sex in individual bedrooms only, not in communal spaces.
*   All genders and orientations are welcome.
*   Free to bring partners to the Hub, with the intention of being respectful to Hubmates and the atmosphere. We’d like it if you felt comfortable enough to be able to introduce them to the Hubmates.

### Alcohol & Other

*   Alcohol is okay in the Hub, however, to be consumed responsibly so that people are still able to be aware and sensitive towards others.
*   Care should be taken to not disrupt the mindful atmosphere of the Hub.
*   Where possible, we aim to let the group know what we are up to, so that we can have open-communication, take care of each other, and know what to do in emergencies. 

### Hub Space

*   The Hub is intended to act as a space for a wider community as well as the Hub residents. We intend to be welcoming and inviting to others, and to be generous-spirited to others being in the space.
*   As with any issues within the resident community it is important that we voice promptly anything that is not working for us so that it can get resolved.
*   We intend to use the spaces in our Hub to occasionally host groups from the wider community (e.g. mindfulness or community groups). While only some of us may be involved in organising a particular group, we all intend to be welcoming to the space being used in this way occasionally.
*   Hub dinners have an optional donation or bring a dish. 

## Further Terms and conditions

* You will need to agree that Life Itself is not liable for any damage to you or your property.
* You are expected to participate in the community and care for the home (eg: cooking, cleaning). Each home may have additional fees (eg: contribution of communal meals).
* Life Itself provides bedcover, sheets, pillow cover and towel.
* When leaving your residency we ask you to not leave any trace unless agreed, and put things back where you found them; to not colonise the space with information (books, dvd’s etc.), and keep information, materials, equipment and spaces available as you found them.
* We will not pick you up at train stations or airports, meaning that you have to come by your own means.
* Hubs can not take animals.
* Residencies are by default for individuals. If you want to come with a partner, the partner should also be applying to be a resident. Please contact us and we can discuss this.
* Payment is by bank transfer within two weeks of receipt of your acceptance to the residency (if this is a problem this can be discussed).
