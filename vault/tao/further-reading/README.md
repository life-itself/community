## Pragmatic Utopians

We believe that a radically better future can be realised — for ourselves, for our societies and for our planet. We are also deeply pragmatic; we are not simply dreaming of this future but intend to incrementally bring it about, and we are experimental and open-minded about how this can be done. In short, we are pragmatic utopians. https://lifeitself.us/2017/10/20/pragmatic-utopians/

## Collective Blind Spots

Cultures inculcate certain ways of thinking and seeing such that collective blindspots emerge; widespread failures within a culture to notice certain things about the world. We believe Western culture creates blindspots driven by individualistic thinking, an over-rating of the power of rationality and progress, and the equality complex. https://lifeitself.us/2019/10/25/introduction-to-our-collective-blind-spots/

## Nine Theses

We want to transform both our systems of production and our collective, spiritual way of being. We believe that spiritual transformation is vital and that our current systems of production contribute to the creation of a way of being which is self-attached, competitive and exclusionary. If the possibilities of abundance and the digital revolution are married with deep spiritual truth and traditions, we believe we can transform society. https://lifeitself.us/2017/05/23/nine-theses/

## A State With Wisdom At Its Heart

We are holding an ongoing enquiry into what it would mean to have a wise political system and what policies would support wise and well collective being. A core part of Life Itself's long-term plan is to undertake wise and contemplative political engagement to address our greatest collective challenges. https://lifeitself.us/2017/09/26/the-state-reinvented/
