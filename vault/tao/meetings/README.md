## Meditation before Meetings

From Chapter 5 of "Joyfully Together" by Thich Nhat Hanh and the Plum Village community:

> We vow to go through this meeting in a spirit of togetherness as we review all ideas and consolidate them to reach a harmonious understanding or consensus. We vow to use the methods of loving speech and deep listening in order to bring about the success of this meeting as an offering to the Three Jewels. We vow not to hesitate to share our ideas and insights but also vow not to say anything when the feeling of irritation is present in us. We are resolutely determined not to allow tension to build up in this meeting. If any one of us senses the start of tension, we will stop immediately and practice [Beginning Anew][] right away so as to re-establish an atmosphere of togetherness and harmony.
