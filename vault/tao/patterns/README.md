# Patterns 

Our patterns describe the way we operate at Life Itself. They include various practices that we maintain, as well as how we operate internally - e.g. how we are organized, manage projects, and get stuff done.

## Practices

Practicing together is at the core of Life Itself. It helps us foster our community, maintain and live our values and vision, and transmit them in our daily life.
