# Why Wisdom

Neither our society nor our planet are as well as they should be. Greater wisdom is needed both in diagnosis and in finding cures.

We emphasize wisdom because we believe this is about more than finding a quick-fix in technology or politics – it is about finding something deeper within ourselves and our societies.

## What we will cover

The week will include meditation, discussions, workshops and embodied activities— plus delicious shared meals and fireside evening discussions.

During the Gathering we will come together to share our vision of Life Itself. It will also be a moment to support each other to fulfil our collective and individual dreams. We will have moments to explore specific areas relating to wisdom and development, both individual and collective, along with more directed discussions around the organisation itself. 

The Gathering is a moment for the mind, heart, soul and body to meet through a powerful shared experience.

We will preserve space in the program to allow for suggestions during the week and we welcome ideas for new topics and activities in advance.

## For whom

We want to bring together all kinds of people who have at their heart a deep concern to help improve the world and a desire to do so wisely.

Farmers, technologists, researchers, lawyers, artists, young, old — all are welcome.

We believe this conversation needs to be open and broad so that we may enhance each other's understanding by sharing our knowledge and skills.

# Discussions

Here are some examples of the kinds of areas we discuss:

**Collective Intelligence:**

We've created a complex society, in which, it seems, no individual can fully understand what is going on around him. How do we put our heads together more effectively to understand the world we live in and solve problems like global warming?

**Renewing the Foundations for Art and Aesthetics:**

The enormous concern that the Art World places on novelty and theory would have been foreign to any previous era of human history. Is this a wise cultural innovation that we’ve made? What can we learn from expression of creativity in other societies?

**Pragmatic Utopianism:**

There is a growing intuition that something is deeply the matter, that, despite so much material progress we are not truly satisfied, happy and at peace. What are our foundational values and views, our big vision and its associated roadmap; and how do we facilitate consensus on these and their implementation in the next fifty to two hundred years?

**Open Information:**

Information is becoming main thing we make, trade and use. The virtual nature of this new world built on ‘bits’ makes it different from the physical world of bread and land and cars which can only have one user at a time. Because information can be used by many at the same time, it makes a world of open information both possible and desirable — that is a world in which all public information can be openly and freely used, shared and built on.

**Techno-solutionism:**

Read Rufus's [blog](https://lifeitself.org/2017/09/18/techno-solutionism/) about the problem of a techno-solutionist mindset.

**An Ode to Possibilities**

Mark and Poppy spoke about aesthetics, philosophy and architecture:

**Life Itself: What did we learn in 2019?**

What are the lessons learnt from our various projects undertaken since the last gathering: the London Hub, The LEAP, iMed and the Institute. It is a moment for us to share learnings across our different initiatives and to think of way to go forward as a collective.
