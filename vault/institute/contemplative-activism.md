Contemplative Activism is the realisation that one of the wellsprings of our social and personal pain and confusion is the lack of a contemplative mindset -- the mindset we are in when we are "connected." Contemplative activism means doing the activism that we already do, such as climate activism, with a contemplative or reflective mindset. It also involves asking ourselves how to be activist on behalf of the contemplative mindset -- to give our wholeness its central place in our lives, organisations, and in society.

We see many expressions of contemplative pursuits such as mindfulness, embodied movement, and trauma healing to name a few. We are collectively exploring contemplative pursuits' of intertwinedness, and co-creating a space for these related pursuits to make each other more whole and more effective.
