## Description

Our hubs are micro-cultures which embody the values of Life Itself. The hubs provide communal environments that support the well-being and self-growth of their residents and foster links with local communities through events, workshops and co-working spaces. The hubs provide a focal point for those interested in societal transformation to meet, discuss and collaborate.
