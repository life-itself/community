## Description

**Crypto & Web3 are a huge phenomenon but can be hard to make sense of. We help with introductions to key concepts and in-depth evaluations of the claims for its social and economic impact.**

## Motivation

In this project, we will be steel-manning the key claims made by proponents of Web3 through conscious, critical and open-minded dialog with a diverse set of experts. Then teasing out the underlying hypotheses and assumptions and engaging in rigorous and constructive critique. Finally, we look at the overall aspirations of the web3 movement and examine how these might be achieved, whether through improvements to [blockchain](https://web3.lifeitself.org/concepts/blockchain) based approaches or by other means.
