## Description

**A Guide to Our Way of Being and Doing**

A combination of our playbook and our concrete envisioning of how pioneering Life Itself aligned communities operate.

Welcome to our community. We are pragmatic utopians, committed to practical action for a radically wiser, weller world. We create coliving hubs, start businesses, do research and engage in activism to pioneer a wiser culture.

This is our tao, or "way". It is a guide to what we stand for and how we operate.

## Motivation

We want a world that is wise, well and awake. We think being changes everything and that key steps to make that wiser world are to a) spearhead a waking up, growing up, cleaning up culture b) make politics cool again to address collective challenges.Â **[See our narrative for more](https://lifeitself.org/tao/narrative)**
