## Description

We are currently renovating the Farmhouse in order to create beautiful spaces for people who want to live together. It will provide a sanctuary and space in which to create a vibrant community, with spacious bedrooms and communal living areas and gardens. We will let you know as soon as the hub is open for residency applications.
