## Description

A series of 3 month-long residencies consisting of a 7-day intensive training in personal and group practices for courageous collective transformation, followed by a 3-week community immersion to integrate and deepen these practices in our daily lives. The immersion includes time and space for you to continue your daily personal work and projects. Note: People can apply to attend just the week-long training, the entire month-long residency, or multiple months of residency.
