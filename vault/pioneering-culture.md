Our pioneering a culture is focused on bottom up change through local intervention. Under this pillar we are creating a sustainable network of communities within existing society through [hubs](https://lifeitself.org/hubs/) and businesses that are pioneering an “awakening” culture – waking up, cleaning up, growing up (teal) and showing up. These would act as a home for members, an engine for our movement and a demonstrator of a new vision for society.
