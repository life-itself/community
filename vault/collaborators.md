#### Plum Village

Life Itself has the privilege to work in collaboration with Plum Village on their Neuroscience retreats.

Plum Village, near Bordeaux in southwest France, is a world renowned practice center for mindfulness, and the first monastic community founded by Zen Master Thich Nhat Hanh in the West. The Plum Village practice has been highly influential in the rise of the modern mindfulness movement.

Plum Village is where Thich Nhat Hanh has realised his dream of building a Beloved Community: creating a healthy, nourishing environment where people can learn the art of living in harmony with one another and with the Earth.

#### Untitled

Life Itself is proud to call Untitled one of our closest collaborators. We have curated the [Imaginary Society](https://lifeitself.org/untitled-imaginary-society/) forum, presented the [Politics of Being](https://lifeitself.org/politics-of-being/) as an experiment and provided more general support and consultation to the project.

UNTITLED’s purpose is to collectively reimagine the society, set the agenda for the most important experiments and execute them together. It is founded by an alliance of activists across sectors. The Alliance and its invitees gather together in an annual festival.

#### CRI

We collaborated with the leading Institute for Interdisciplinary research in France, CRI in organising a dialogue on the Open Science of Learning. You can read the white paper which arose out of this exchange here: [https://artearthtech.files.wordpress.com/2020/06/the-world-needs-a-truly-open-science-of-learning.pdf](/assets/the-world-needs-a-truly-open-science-of-learning.pdf)

CRI was founded by François Taddei and Ariel Lindner in 2005 to create a student/researcher centered open environment in which they can collaborate together to build a world where lifelong learning is at the heart of our society.

To help everyone take care of oneself, others and the planet, CRI is co-constructing and sharing new ways of learning, teaching and mobilising collective intelligence in the fields of life, learning and digital sciences.

Sitting at the crossroads of research and education, CRI advocates for innovative pedagogy putting the student at the heart of their own learning experience through projects, research and societal challenges.

#### iMed

Today, millions of people around the world cannot afford access to life-saving medicines. Monopoly rights awarded to drug discoverers keep prices high and restrict competition. Health providers are in crisis, and have to make tough choices about what drugs they can afford to provide. A new system is needed. Incentives for pharmaceutical R&D need to be connected to healthcare outcomes to increase access to medicine while simultaneously encouraging research innovation.

The best resolution to the tension between access and innovation is a remuneration rights model that removes the dilemma and offers incentives for both innovation and access; it provides a free market, state-independent mechanism resourced by the state and philanthropists that incentivises innovations via remuneration based on health impact, on condition that the innovations are free to use and unrestricted, allowing for competition in manufacturing and therefore lower prices for medicines whilst providing incentives for innovators at a similar level to today.

#### Life Cloud

Life Itself provided support to Laurie Parma and Life Cloud in well-being research.

In the midst of highest technological advances and human tightest interconnectedness: it’s incredible that depression would be a worldwide epidemic. Cities are the loneliest places in the world, and an entire generation is going through a purpose crisis. With a lack of inspiring vision, people are not quite sure where to start amongst the many philosophies and ‘ought to’.

Life Cloud is dedicated to create the mental, physical, emotional and social arenas that will allow us to move beyond ourselves and flourish. We assess, consult, develop and deliver wellbeing programs for individuals, businesses or for their HR services.
