# Ken Wilber

Ken Wilber is the creator of [[integral|Integral]] Theory, a pioneer of transpersonal psychology and has been described as the Einstein of consciousness studies.

We consider his work foundational to the emerging paradigm.

Wilber's subject matter and style has limited his recognition within academia and  the broader mainstream. Nevertheless, his work has been hugely influential both directly ad especially indirectly. To take just one example, Laloux's [[Reinventing Organizations]] directly cites and uses Wilber's stages of cultural evolution.[^1]
