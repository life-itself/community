* 2022-01-07 Thoughts on structure of Life Itself **ðŸŽ¬ draw a diagram**
  * Central fund "core"
    * Why? ðŸ”‘ so that you have a place for money from e.g. atomatic or otherwise to come from.
    * Is this CIC or Ltd or an.other enterprise (e.g. proper charity)
  * Money goes into there in exchange for shares
  * Central fund lends, or "invests", or "donates"
    * If gives, limits on charity giving)
  * Individual projects operate the way they do
  * What determines a Life Itself initiative? ðŸ’¬ this does not matter for now IMO
