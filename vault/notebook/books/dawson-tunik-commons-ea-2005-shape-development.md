# The shape of development by Dawson-Tunik et al (2005)

Key points:

- Can we find robust evidence that there are stages of development
- Assess moral development across life span (Kolhberg questions)
- Pool data from several studies to get ~ 750 samples
- Assess with Lectica levels which is concept-neutral
- Find good evidence that
  - there are stages
  - development is not continuous (i.e. plateau-ing)
- How: can see if very distinct lectica levels happen at same time for a person - if no strong indication for stages
- How: can see whether mostly in same level and then at some point see-sawing (transitioning) => this would give evidence for plateau-ing (or not)
