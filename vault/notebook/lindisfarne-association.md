# Lindisfarne Association

Founded by cultural historian William Irwin Thompson. It was "a contemplative education community devoted to the study and realization of a new planetary culture."[^1] Can see it as inspiration and precursor of Life Itself.

Had extraordinary set of members e.g. [[David Steindl-Rast]] and many more as per https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindisfarne_Association

A bit ahead of its time and probably more head and heart than hand -- i.e. less focused on pragmatism and doing.

Also perhaps somewhat new-age e.g.

> The Lindisfarne doctrine is closely related to that of its founder, William Thompson. Mentioned as part of the Lindisfarne ideology are a long list of spiritual and esoteric traditions including yoga, Tibetan Buddhism, Chinese traditional medicine, Hermeticism, Celtic animism, Gnosticism, cabala, geomancy, ley lines, Pythagoreanism, and ancient mystery religions.[8]

> The group placed a special emphasis on sacred geometry, defined by Thompson as "a vision of divine intelligence, the logos, revealing itself in all forms, from the logarithmic spiral of a seashell to the hexagonal patterns of cooling basalt, from the architecture of the molecule to the galaxy."[9] Rachel Fletcher, Robert Lawlor, and Keith Critchlow lectured at Crestone on the application of sacred geometry, Platonism, and Pythagoreanism to architecture.[10] The exemplar of these ideas is the Grail Chapel in Crestone (also known as Lindisfarne Chapel), which is built to reflect numerous basic geometrical relationships.[11] [From Wikipedia]
