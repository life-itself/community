# Assessment of Transformative Programs

We're interested in assessing transformative programs including our own ECT. We need to identify both factors we wish to assess and measures for assessing them.

## What kind of areas to assess

- Wellbeing
- Purpose
- Ability to deal with conflict
- Group dynamics
- Perspectives

## Existing Work

- [ ] Inner Development Goals
- [ ] Wisdom related measures

### Examples of assessment scales used by Martin and NonSymbolic

From Martin, J. A. (20210909). Effects of two online positive psychology and meditation programs on persistent self-transcendence. Psychology of Consciousness: Theory, Research, and Practice https://doi.org/10.1037/cns0000286  (in library)

> Participants were assessed using the Authentic Happiness Inventory, Satisfaction with Life Scale, PERMA, Fordyce Emotions Questionnaire, Center for Epidemiology Studies Depression questionnaire, State/Trait Anxiety Inventory, Perceived Stress Scale, Gratitude Questionnaire, Mysticism Scale, Modified Nondual Embodiment Thematic Inventory, and Meaning in Life Questionnaire. After the program, participants were sorted into seven categories of self-transcendence: none, temporary, and five increasing degrees of persistent self-transcendence. Results from each measure were broken out by category, and compared within and across cohorts.

**NB: this paper is a nice example of rigorously measuring and assessing a novel and related area**
