YouTube video they link: [Ellie Hain on the Social Imaginary/Collective Imaginary](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNT7y-vovT4). Also read her essay https://www.elliehain.com/imaginaries-and-the-breakdown-of-normality (main thing linked on her site)

- Seems to be a synonym for worldview (or cultural frame).
- Why adopt the term "imaginary"?
- An emphasis on very deep (ontological) worldview i.e. we are thinking about the very [[nature of being for human beings]]
- Gives example of hunter-gatherer => agriculture or agriculture => industrial societies. These involved big mindset shifts.
  - [Ed: again I'd just term these worldviews or culture and that culture includes an implicit ontology, epistemology etc]
- Seems terminology may trace to [[abc/Charles Taylor]] (sources of the self etc) who wrote *Modern Social Imaginaries (2003)*

Hello everyone so today i'm going to be talking about  imaginaries now imaginaries it's a word  that keeps coming up a lot recently we  talk about  social imaginaries collective  imaginaries the imaginary of society  and it's something that we seem to  intuitively grasp  however very few people are actually  clear on what that concept means  which is a shame because they are so  important to understand current times  so let's go with it what are they okay  so  imagine that you want to understand the  nature of reality  so we have of course the natural world where we have  chemistry physics biology nature the  great outdoors  but we are social animals so we don't  only live in the natural world  we have the social dimension where we  create  art culture ideology politics markets  economies  states law but in order to create all of  these phenomena  we need to essentially create a new  dimension and that is what we call the  social imaginary and now you might be  thinking  nice sounds like you just invented  another fancy word for culture  or ideology and you may have a point  because they  are indeed quite similar in some ways  but  they are actually different and the  essential difference is that we need an  imaginary  in order to be able to create these  other concepts so the imaginary  is the territory or the background where  we create  concepts like culture or ideology and  the following question would be  nice but why does this differentiation  matter  like at all and here's the thing the  truth is that in most cases  it doesn't really matter that much  because most of the time  the conversation that we're in or the  plane of thinking that we're at  doesn't really go that deep that  abstract into the level of imaginaries  however there are certain times where  talking about imaginaries  is essential and those are times where  civilization humanity  is undergoing very deep and massive  transformations  like when we went from 100 gallery  societies to agricultural societies  or from agricultural societies to the  modern industrial ones  now in those cases the types of culture  change or mindset change  that are needed in order to keep up with  everything that's going on in society  cannot just happen at the level of  culture or ideology  but really needs to be deep at the level  of imaginaries and i know that this is  quite abstract so let me give you  a very true history-based example so  some of you might have heard of this  quote by ursula kellegging who is  the absolute queen of imaginaries that  says that the power of capitalism may  seem inescapable  but so did the divine right of kings and  this quote is super important because  it points out to the fact that  imaginaries  tend to be constructed around some key  concepts that dictate  essentially how we perceive our whole  social existence so let's dig deep into  that  now let's look back quite some years  into  our pre-modern social imaginary that is  the middle ages  now in those times our whole social  order was constructed around the idea of  god  the divine king and the underlying  mythological order of the cosmos  now those ideas inform everything about  our whole social world and social  existence  like how we perceive ourselves we're  basically here our whole worth as a  person  is directly related to how close i am to  god which  if you're a priest or a king or a noble  quite a lot but if you're a peasant  it's essentially zero or how we related  to others  like forget notions of equality like  that's cute  now here what matters is a divine order  of the universe  where everyone everyone is exactly where  god intended them to be  no matter if you're a priest a peasant  or a princess you're  exactly in your right place and of  course they also affect how we perceive  the broader systems that we're ingrained  in like for example  how should we take decisions or how do  we know what's good  or who should rule things well of course  it's all according to god's word  i love it or hate it the truth is that  this story worked relatively well  until the 18th century came with the  scientific and industrial revolutions  and of course the modern indictment and  at this point  the story of gods and kings just didn't  really cut it anymore  and gradually a new story starts to  emerge now we're talking about the  market economy  and the revolutionary idea of  nation-states  not ruled by kings but by sovereign  individuals and instead of looking at  the world  exclusively through the divine order and  god's word narrationality comes into  place  which now this concept might seem  extremely obvious because we're just  leaving painting them  but then that was extremely  revolutionary and so slowly but surely  all these concepts started to permeate  and infiltrate every aspect of our  social life  now we don't think of ourselves anymore  as mere servants of our god of our king  no now we are proud citizens of our  nations and productive members of the  economy  and instead of just accepting god-given  hierarchies now we think of ourselves  as autonomous goal-driven individuals  that we can collaborate with each other  and make agreements  that we should stick to them with honor  and responsibility well  at least if you're a white man and that  thing about just ruling the whole of  society according to god's word  how embarrassing no now we have the  scientific method  secular humanism and economic  rationality and we're able to measure  everything  and see how effective things really are  and we try to implement  at least some kind of meritocracy that  is based on  reason and efficiency and not just on  religious ideology now of course  this doesn't really happen on a  conscious level imaginaries are more  like the collective unconscious  it's not like we just go around every  day explicitly thinking  oh i must be a productive member of  society today or else it'll be  completely worthless  no this manifests on a much more subtle  level  like for example when we tie our  identity so much with our profession  and you know the classic story here you  meet someone you say your name and then  two seconds later  what do you do or it's also the reason  why our idea of making it or of success  is essentially identical with being a  high achiever in the modern economy or  my personal favorite when we feel  this deep deep existential guilt  and even worthlessness when we are not  being as productive as we'd like to  and oh my god the pandemic absolutely  hit us hard there  but it's okay i know there's no shame  we've all been there it's not us it's  the imaginary and you know that thing  that i was saying before  that imaginaries are the background  where we create concepts like  culture or ideology well that is just so  painstakingly clear  when you realize that the main  ideologies that we invented in the  modern age  they all essentially refer either to the  economy  like communism capitalism socialism or  to the nation state like fascism so as  you see  imaginaries are incredibly powerful  they really are like the dark matter of  society that holds everything together  or like the deep code that's running us  without us being aware of that  but despite of all their power or  precisely because of their power  the truth is that imaginaries remain  completely invisible to us  and that's why a very common metaphor to  refer to them is to say that imaginaries  are like water for the fish so it's  something that is all around us that we  are completely ingrained in and that we  need  for living however we are completely  unaware of them but still  we must make an effort in really trying  to understand them  because at the point where society is at  with all the massive transformations  that are happening right now  the kinds of change that need to happen  that  culture change that systems change that  revolution tm can't just happen  at the level of culture or ideology  really needs to be much deeper  at the level of the imaginary because  looking back at the way that we  transitioned  from pre-modern middle ages to the  modern society the modern enlightenment  imaginary  was not just through arguing which king  is best  or which god is best because we know  that these discussions only got us stuck  in endless wars and crusades no  what we had was a radical reimagination  of our whole society  in a way that we created new concepts  that transcended  those of gods and kings so similarly  today  the discussion at the level of how can  my country do it best  or which is the best way to organize the  economy well  it's not that they're not needed but  they won't be enough in these times  the kind of change that we need requires  again a much more radical reimagination  of our whole social existence and again  we need to create new concepts that  include but  move beyond the ideas of the economy and  nation states  we need to start asking questions like  in the age of globalization  and automatization how do we perceive  ourselves  beyond the life of a hard worker of the  economy  and a proud citizen of our country or in  the age where we are  constantly interacting with diverse  people and perspectives  and where fixed roles and identities  seem to constantly dissolve  how do we then know what good fair and  meaningful relationships look like  or in the age of climate change which  new standards do we set for ourselves  that go beyond efficiency  or in the age of infinite data and  information overwhelm  and of systems thinking and complexity  science  and where we're only now starting to  awaken to the interconnectedness of all  of our systems  how do we then know what is true how do  we make sense of the world  that is a deep kind of imaginary change  that i'm talking about  how do we then create that kind of  change and here's where the tricky part  comes  because imaginaries rather than being  intellectual theories that we can create  about how the world works or how the  world should work  are more like the ways of being that  emerge  out of the way the world actually works  so in this case it's just not enough to  gather a bunch of thinkers a bunch of  philosophers  to theorize about how should the new  utopia look like  well we don't need the theories  imaginaries aren't  actually made of them they are made of  stories images metaphors  myths memes that without us knowing they  just  shape and run our collective imagination  and provide us with direction and  meaning but in a much more subtle and  evocative way  so yes we don't need the philosophers  but in terms of imaginary  we especially need the artists the  storytellers the creatives the mean  makers  all these people who are engaged in the  work of translating theory  into imaginary and that create the  stories in the universe  that without us knowing we all live and  breathe and then  what we also need in these uncertain  times  is for everyone that instead of trying  so hard  to go back to our old notions of  normality  or stability well maybe we can start to  be  more present in the current moment and  more open and perceiving  to other ways of being of doing of  relating or of knowing  that wouldn't have been really apparent  was before  but that make much more sense for the  new world that wants to emerge  and it's maybe then when everyone's  playing their role  well that that no imaginary will be born  you
