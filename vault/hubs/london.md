## Northern line on your doorstep

Our London Hub is just a 10 minute walk to Old Street station, connecting you to the Bank branch of the Northern Line, as well as the Great Northern national rail service and buses toward Oxford Circus, Paddington, and Waterloo. 

## Culture at your fingertips

Shoreditch is renowned for its social and cultural offers, so whatever your taste, you’ll never be short of places to eat, drink, and be. 

## Your own private sanctuary 

We offer a range of rooms to suit your budget. Rooms come fully furnished, with bed linen included. Ready when you are. 

## Where beauty meets function

Our communal kitchen and living spaces have been designed to give you everything you need, whether you’re cooking or conversing. Our minimalist design strips away the clutter, leaving you to focus on what really matters: one another. 

## Never stop growing

Our events programme is run by you, the community, so whether it’s foreign film night or a workshop on permaculture, you’re in charge.
