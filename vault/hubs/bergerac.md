The Bergerac Hub offers opportunities to explore what it really means to live more consciously together.

The Hub is nestled near the River Dordogne and just a few minutes walk from Bergerac's beautiful town centre. A perfect location from which to enjoy both the glorious French countryside and the vibrant medieval town.

The Hub is used both as a Life Itself Praxis Hub and is available to other groups and communities to create their own retreats, workshops and residencies. If you are interested please [contact us](https://lifeitself.org/contact/).

## Overview

The house is finely decorated with antique furniture and a rare view onto the Dordogne. It is situated just a few steps from the river itself, and a beautiful park in a quiet area. The space is one of a kind, and its atmospheric surroundings are the perfect setting for deep exploration.

## Bedrooms

There are three types of bedroom: basic, standard, premium. Basic are still functional but are smaller and are not ensuite.

**There are currently 8 rooms available at the Hub: 2 basic, 3 premium and 3 standard.**

7 of these rooms are capable of being shared if desired, however for the best experience we recommend booking a standard room or above if you wish to share.

### Basic

Our smallest rooms are still pleasantly furnished, just without the bells and whistles. Single beds throughout.

### Standard

Generously sized with double beds throughout and still impressively furnished. No ensuite bathrooms but easy bathroom access.

#### By train üöÜ

Bergerac has a train station. We're a 20 minute walk from it through the heart of the beautiful medieval part of the town.

There are regular services from Bergerac to and from Bordeaux Saint-Jean, taking just over 1 hour. From there it is easy to reach much of the rest of France, for example it is a couple of hours to Paris.

#### By air ‚úàÔ∏è

We are only an 8 minute drive from Bergerac Dordogne P√©rigord Airport, or alternatively it is easy to fly into Bordeaux and then travel by rail or car from there.

#### By car üöó

The Hub is a little over 1 hour 30 minutes from Bordeaux by car, around 2 hours 40 minutes from Toulouse, and a little under 5 hours from Lyon.

There is free parking right in front of the hub at Place Barbacane and alongside the riverside next to the house.

üö© If you park in Place Barbacane itself you need to move your car out of there every Thursday night (by ~11pm) until Friday afternoon because of the market that takes place on Place Barbacane.

Alternative free parking can be found in the riverside and the public parking lot named¬† ‚ÄúJean Barth√©‚Äù (google maps), 3 min. walk from the hub.
