## What is Life Itself?

We are pragmatic utopians, committed to practical action for a radically wiser, weller world. We create coliving hubs, start businesses, do research and engage in activism to pioneer a wiser culture. We are ordinary people who choose an extra-ordinary path, treading the middle way between [Plum Village](https://www.plumvillage.uk/) and Silicon Valley.

## Why do we exist?

Despite our wealth and technologies, we are struggling at both a personal and collective levels. Personally, we are are not truly happy, satisfied and at peace; collectively we are failing to act powerfully on issues ranging from climate change to health. We believe the roots of both of these lie in our culture – which is grounded in materialism, technology and individualism – and thus a breakthrough requires a transformation in culture: the views, values, beliefs, practices that underlie our collective way of being.

## How are we going to change things?

Real change requires us to work, and even live, together – hence creating co-living spaces and businesses; and to share ideas through writing and events, ultimately engaging in politics and social change.

## Why are we different?

We balance the spiritual and the rational. We like meditation as much as we like getting things done. We want meaningful work and a meaningful life. We value the environment and technology, art and science. We take action, both personal and political. We’re the middle way between the suit and the hippy, between the billionaire and the monk.

## Our People

Our team consists of artists, researchers, technologists and community builders. Despite these varied backgrounds, each shares a commitment to being wise and taking practical action to solve the collective challenges facing our society and culture.

## Our Work

### Hubs

Life Itself has three co-living venues: two in Bergerac and one in Berlin. These “hubs” are central to Life Itself’s mission of bringing together value-aligned people to tackle the collective action problems that threaten our future. They exist as a living, breathing representation of Life Itself’s culture, and provide a ready-made community for those eager to make a difference. Read more about [our hubs](https://lifeitself.org/hubs/).

### **Research**

The Life Itself Institute exists to answer the questions of what it means to live well and live wisely. We conduct rigorous research that is guided by the insights of ancient wisdom traditions, reintegrating lessons that have otherwise been lost in the spheres of science and policymaking.

### The Gathering

Life Itself hosts a week-long annual gathering in our Bergerac [Hubs](https://lifeitself.org/hubs/). It exists to facilitate conversation on what living wisely looks like, and has a structured programme of workshops, talks, and group activities like meditation, dance classes, and late night bonfires.

### Calls

Life Itself hosts a number of online calls that exist to bring people together so they can collaborate and share their work in an uplifting environment. Offerings include the Get Stuff Done series, which is a daily practice designed to hold you accountable to achieving your goals, and the Creative Practice calls, which bring creatives together for one hour per week to deepen their practice. See our [current range here.](https://lifeitself.org/calls/)
