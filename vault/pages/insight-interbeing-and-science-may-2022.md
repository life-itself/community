> _Humanity needs a kind of spirituality that we can all practice together. Dogmatism and fanaticism have been the cause of great separation and war. In the twenty-first century ... it will be possible to establish a cosmic religion based not on myth, belief, or dogma, but on evidence and the insight of interbeing."_
> 
> Thich Nhat Hanh

## Key Info

In this residency we will humbly consider the possibility raised above by Thich Nhat Hanh, and collaboratively explore how insight into [interbeing](https://www.mindfulnessbell.org/archive/tag/interbeing) can be cultivated in a way that is supported by personal inquiry and understanding of science. The group living context of the Bergerac practice hub provides a perfect space to deepen our insight into interbeing while leaving participants enough time to work remotely. We will also explore the potential and limitations of science for supporting spiritual practice. How can the vital insights of spirituality be communicated using science and contemplative inquiry? What new science can be done in order to help more people access ancient spiritual insights?

- **What**: A residency that allows us to collaboratively deepen our contemplative insight, particularly into interbeing, in a spirit of inquiry consistent with science. We can do this best with like-minded people, and will have time for remote working, too. We will look to refine practices together, and deepen our understanding of the potential and limitations of science for understanding spirituality.
- **When:** 6 May - 20 May 2022
- **Where**: [Life Itself Praxis Hub, Bergerac, France](https://lifeitself.org/hubs/bergerac/) (near Bordeaux)
- **Who**: anyone interested in insight, interbeing, and science.
- **Facilitators**: [Liam Kavanagh](https://lifeitself.org/people/), [Phoebe Tickell](http://www.phoebetickell.com/) & [Jamie Bristow](https://www.jamiebristow.com/)
- **Cost** : €400-550 (plus €210 for food) depending on room type.  
- **Notes on costs:** our aim is that cost is not an obstacle to anyone in participating. If finance is an issue please get in touch and we will see if we can provide support in some way or another.

## Overview

## Residency Structure

The exact structure is deliberately left with some flexibility in order to adapt to the needs of the group who joins us (approximately 12 people) but some of the core elements will include:

Work Time: It is important to note that the schedule of the residency is meant to allow people to work remotely (i.e. it should be comfortable to work 35-40 hours a week.)

_Group Inquiry_: 3-4 evenings a week we will have a group practice or inquiry based around the residency's core theme. The organisers have ideas, but participants are encouraged to make suggestions.

_Meals Together_: Lunch every weekday. Participants will come to an agreement together about dinner and weekend cooking arrangements.

_Daily practices_: Morning and evening meditation is available, and mindful working in groups to maintain the space and cook.
