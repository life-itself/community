Oh silence.  
What is that cry we hear?  
The lament of a passing epoch,  
Or the voice of a newborn age?  
Ghosts of the past come to visit,  
They wander unmourned.  
So, the old world persists.  
And the future whispers in words unformed  
  
_by Sylvie Barbier and Simon Longstaff_

## How do we start?

We start with funerals, with requiems, with mourning.

So that the past may rest in peace and the future is free of its ghosts.
