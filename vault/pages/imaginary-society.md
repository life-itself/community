We're delighted to be collaborating with [Untitled](https://untitled.community/) to curate and host the _[Imaginary Society](https://untitled.community/events/imaginary-society/)_.

Imaginary Society is an open interview series where we seek to exercise our social imagination in theory and in practice. Put simply: what could a different (and better) world look like and how would we get there?

We are particularly keen to go deep: we believe a powerful social imagination requires us to break out of our default world-views -- our ingrained assumptions about ourselves and our societies.

Each forum features an expert guest. We normally follow a conversational/interview though some fora feature an initial uninterrupted talk or presentation followed by Q&A.

#### About Jeremy Lent

[Jeremy Lent](https://www.jeremylent.com/), described by Guardian journalist George Monbiot as “one of the greatest thinkers of our age,” is an author and speaker whose work investigates the underlying causes of our civilization’s existential crisis, and explores pathways toward a life-affirming future.

His award-winning book, [The Patterning Instinct: A Cultural History of Humanity's Search for Meaning](https://www.jeremylent.com/the-patterning-instinct.html), explores the way humans have made meaning from the cosmos from hunter-gatherer times to the present day. His new book, [The Web of Meaning: Integrating Science and Traditional Wisdom to Find Our Place in the Universe](https://www.jeremylent.com/the-web-of-meaning.html), offers a coherent and intellectually solid foundation for a worldview based on connectedness that could lead humanity to a sustainable, flourishing future.

In this session Jeremy will take us through his thinking, and explore what it might mean for humanity's future in this time of crisis.

#### VestAndPage

Verena Stenke and Andrea Pagnes have been working together as [VestAndPage](https://www.vest-and-page.de/) for over a decade, and gained international recognition for their work in performance art, performance-based film, writing, and publishing. Their work moves between the unseen and the unforeseen, the unsaid, the forgotten, and the repressed; it has involved [collective performance operas](https://09486d6f-69e4-45f6-bed3-e698b73b1be3.filesusr.com/ugd/fa6502_4e9260b900dc43b4abdebd28e5bc32c5.pdf?index=true), and the creation of [temporary artistic communities](https://09486d6f-69e4-45f6-bed3-e698b73b1be3.filesusr.com/ugd/fa6502_a7fb630c9c3f4cf19204277b0f8416f4.pdf?index=true). They will remind us that to imagine differently is to see, listen, and relate differently. At the convergence of multiple crises, how can we change our gaze to imagine a different future?
