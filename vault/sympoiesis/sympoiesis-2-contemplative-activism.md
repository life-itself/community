**Question: What is our response to the un-contemplative mess that we’re in ?** 

**![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/LX6Flyw2AdpNkS-orDQ2jjpiis-DPXXnj28-Yda_9mwgPrBb_l7ILOfTAfddsOIFhvZ2cw4liOgm6yr2mhEZHUTfcj9-cN2unHq_hQkXsO3vf_mwDAcLfM1nbFKcMcO-tLY_iuB0=s0)**

# **Introduction**

Sympoiesis #2 is the second in the series of month-long residencies that are a spiritual cooking-together of various ingredients: people, practices, workshops, art, community life and actual cooking. The ingredients are drawn by the opening of a space, a vacuum to be filled by people and practices too spiritual for politics, too “political” for the monasteries. The idea that life can be divorced from spirit is at the heart of our trouble. Let’s sit with this great trouble without giving into the narrowing impulse to “save the world.”

Residencies combine both an activating frame of collective practices and a time space dedicated for writing on C.A , on a specific project or/ and daily work – A key aspect is learning how we can integrate community and practice, collective and private, absolute and relative in our daily life.

## The theme for this Sympoiesis is : Contemplative Activism

Contemplative Activism is a response to the realisation that one of the wellsprings of our social and personal pain and confusion is the lack of a contemplative mindset -- the mindset we are in when we are "connected." Contemplative activism involves doing the activism that we already do, such as climate activism, with a contemplative mindset. It also involves asking ourselves how to be active on behalf of the contemplative mindset -- to give our wholeness its overriding place in our lives, organisations, and in society. Contemplative activism is a disposition to stay with our trouble and be guided to action by what rises.

These definitions of Contemplative Activism have emerged from our group who have been contemplating this question. We have just begun. Many other aspects of Contemplative Activism are emerging and this is what this residency is about . 

The design for this practice will be developed under the principle of contemplation, meaning we will sit, cook, eat together and create the adapted design for our group and writing goal of publishing a book on contemplative activism. During this sympoiesis a silent retreat will be organised open to guests interested to connect with us. 

Valerie Duvauchelle will be our tenzo and will guide us to compose menus which brings clarity and energy under the principles of Shojin cuisine, the zen temple food.

# **Schedule?**

Here is an outline of the schedule. It will be processed contemplatively, meaning we will sit together and create the adapted daily collective design for our group and writing goals of publishing a book that builds on the work all of us have been doing for eighteen months in Contemplative Activism. 

- 7h00 to 7h30 am- body awakening 
- 7h30 to 8h30 am - silent sitting 
- 8h30 to 9h00 - community work ( chopping and cleaning )
- 9h30 to 12h30- C.A session practice ( including cooking )
- 13h00 lunch
- 15h00 to 18h00- CA session session practice ( including cooking)
- 19h00 diner
- 20h30 zazen

Fridays and Weekends will be retreat time or private time . Every monday mornings we will adjust our design to the needs of our group.

_This way people will have a daily structure to center themselves and experience what is the effect of a community moving together along the day. This residency welcomes people who need to work as a part of the retreats. Most of the CA session will be optional and could be dedicated to personal work , though many of us are devoting a good deal of time to writing._

# **FAQs particular to this residency**

## What is Contemplation?

By contemplation we mean: an ability that humans are gifted with for immersing ourselves in what we are attending to, allowing what is actual is to inspire thoughts rather than thoughts framing our view of what actually is. It has a feeling, you know it. This is something we all get into at points in our life. A contemplative practice is an activity, that involves by its nature, arousing this quality of experience. Nature poetry, for example, virtually requires us to contemplate nature so that we are inspired. Opening ourselves to inspiration is inherently contemplative. As the retreat has an artistic intention, we will be doing a lot of this kind of practice along with other practices which are more commonly thought of as contemplative, like meditations of various kinds.

### Can I come for less than a month?

We will give preference to participants who can commit to a month for the purposes of allowing a real community of practice to emerge. For the people who can’t have the opportunity to stay 2 weeks we offer the possibility to receive people as guests 3 or 5 days around retreats time.

### Can you offer discounts?

Please contact us if your financial situation makes it difficult for you to attend. We do our best to ensure people are able to attend and maybe able to offer special support. However please remember that to still consider retreats donations participation in order to support the service of the curator. 

### How much will food cost?

We hope to maintain a 7 euros budget per resident and per day . 8 euros for guests.

What are the menus?

All food will be free of animal product and 95 percent organic. During retreats will be 90 % gluten free ( use of bulgur or spelt flour).Every meal will be carefully balanced in terms of proteins by the cooks .
