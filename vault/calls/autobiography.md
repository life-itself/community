## Write!

Our coach will guide you through a series of artistic and written tasks that you’ll complete during the week, which form the foundation of your new narrative, and in essence, your new self.

## Create!

Creativity needs practice, and practice needs community. We will guide you through exercises (from collage creation to spontaneous writing) to strengthen your creativity, discover blindspots of your past to transform your future story.

## Stay connected 

Our Whatsapp group, exclusive to Autobiography participants, is a place to share, discuss, and keep the conversation alive throughout the week. Share your stories, inspire your peers.

## Stay motivated

Radical transformation is tough. It’s even tougher on your own. Our community provides support and accountability, so you can finally do the work your inner journey needs. 

## Community wherever you are

Not everyone has a local personal development community. Our online sessions enable you to join us from wherever you are, and gives you access to the coaches and peers you might never have met otherwise.

## Get into flow

Your best work is done when in a state of flow. Evenings are a great time for reflection. Find a calm, uninterrupted comfortable space and join us 6:30pm - 8pm UKT every Wednesday for seven weeks.

## Up next

Every Wednesday 3rd February - Wednesday 24th March 2021 6:30pm UKT
