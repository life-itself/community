We are excited to welcome acclaimed author Jeremy Lent to the next online Imaginary Society Forum on 9th September 2021.

The Zoom session will run for 1.5 hours starting at 5pm CEST/11am EDT. The Forum will see Life Itself co-founder Rufus Pollock discuss with Jeremy his work and its implications for humanity's future, before giving space for questions and discussion.

[Jeremy Lent](https://www.jeremylent.com/), described by Guardian journalist George Monbiot as “one of the greatest thinkers of our age,” is an author and speaker whose work investigates the underlying causes of our civilization’s existential crisis, and explores pathways toward a life-affirming future.

His award-winning book, [The Patterning Instinct: A Cultural History of Humanity's Search for Meaning](https://www.jeremylent.com/the-patterning-instinct.html), explores the way humans have made meaning from the cosmos from hunter-gatherer times to the present day. His new book, [The Web of Meaning: Integrating Science and Traditional Wisdom to Find Our Place in the Universe](https://www.jeremylent.com/the-web-of-meaning.html), offers a coherent and intellectually solid foundation for a worldview based on connectedness that could lead humanity to a sustainable, flourishing future.

For anyone interested in how humanity might overcome the crises currently facing us this talk is a must see, so sign up below!
