In the fourth episode of our Exploring Social Transformation series, [Nathen Fitchen](http://www.nathenfitchen.com) and [Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://www.brendangrahamdempsey.com/) discuss the rise of the meaning crisis, how it has perpetuated throughout the world and its symbiotic nature to the environmental crisis and other crises we face today.

Nathen and Brendan unpack a potential antidote to the meaning crisis, metamodern spirituality. Through identifying the core characteristics of metamodern thinking and how one might engage in metamodern spirituality, this conversation is a perfect place to orient oneself with the metamodern ideology and to be inspired to find greater meaning individually and as a collective.
