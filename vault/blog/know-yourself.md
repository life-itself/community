In our last Creative Practice Call we wrote a "Love letter to the future" dedicated to our grand children. Below is a powerful letter by Harry Bonnell.

**We are offering our Morning Creative Practice calls every **Thursday** 7:30- 8:30am (UK). First one starts on the 11th of June until the 16th July. Book yourself for £35.**

Know yourself. For only in this way can you know others. And it is through others that we are shaped and influenced.  
Know whether you are reactive or a planner; love structure or are suspicious of it. None are good or bad, but each means a different life.  
Know what makes you tick; your strengths and weaknesses; your suspicions, superstitions and simple solutions; your moods and why you have them.

And look for beauty. For you become what you look for. Seek out musicians and dancers, for they usually will develop you.  
You do not have to be 'top dog'. Just be important to who is important to you - and if many people, or great people, are important to you then maybe this will drive you on.  
Know others, for it is only in this way you'll know yourself. Listen to their lifes, their strengths and hopes and strains. See if they talk fast and avoid silence or whether they are quiet and surprise often, neither are good or bad.  
Life is long, and if you live well it will have memories which transcend time. Live well. With love, expansive love. Harry
