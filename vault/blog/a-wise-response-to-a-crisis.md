# Our response to the Coronavirus

This one minute film Danger, Opportunity, Meaning and Hope distils our thoughts for our call on Saturday - created by member Richard Millington   
_\- and subscribe to our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmBq3VO9w_MLTKD_CHsYN-Q/featured?view_as=public) for more videos of our salons and events_

The Chinese word for crisis is composed of the word “Danger” and “Opportunity”. Right now, there is a lot of the conversation in the public space coming from a place of  “fear” and focused on the danger and disruption. Here, at Art/ Earth / Tech we would like to emphasize more the “opportunity” – without in any way diminishing or denying the suffering arising for people – but focusing more on the lessons and reflection that we may take from it?  
  
Let’s dare to dream together and paint a new world, one where we trust and learn from the lessons the Coronavirus has to offer, come join us in our open **Online Community day this [Saturday evening 28th March 6-8pm (CET),  5-7pm (UK)](https://zoom.us/j/659327540)**

# Essay: Outbreak 

### by Charlotte du Cann

Charlotte du Cann is a writer, editor and co-director of the [Dark Mountain Project](https://dark-mountain.net/). She is involved in our Contemplative Activism Sangha and recently spoke at the Human // Nature // Stories event held in London by member Hannah Close. You can watch her talk, [The Kist,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r3jHD3r0wy0) which she mentions in the essay below.  

_"Having resisted every warning and admonishment to transform and change our ways, we are now, as a collective, being forced into a cocoon ourselves, to do the work we should have done generations ago...I am bereft of access to places and people I once loved. But I know this loss is part of the payback, the great sobriety, what Bendell has termed the second R of Relinquishment, ‘what we need to let go of that is making the crisis worse’."_

# Blog: Letting go of being enlightened

### by Liam Kavanagh

"Is now the time when we start to truly realise that when we declared our enlightenment a few centuries ago, we were a bit premature and to make a course correction?

I don’t know, but I feel certain that our decision making is impaired by massive attachments to these notions: that we can control fate through reason and science, that we are separate individuals living “our own lives”, and dogmatic ideals of equality. In the paper, I discuss how these ideas relate to our inaction in the face of the long-standing threat of climate change."  
Here, Liam discusses how they have affected our coronavirus response. [https://artearthtech.com/2020/03/25/letting-go-of-being-enlightened/](https://artearthtech.com/2020/03/25/letting-go-of-being-enlightened/)

# Practice

We need our practice more than ever, particularly in the confines of our homes with our loved ones! These regular group meditations are excellent. 

### Love Vs Virus

# Book(s)

**[Die Wise](https://orphanwisdom.com/die-wise/): [A Manifesto for Sanity and Soul](https://orphanwisdom.com/shop/die-wise/) by Stephen Jenkins**, a palliative nurse in Canada and founder of Orphan Wisdom. Stephen describes our uncomfortable relationship to dying through real experiences he has had at the bedside of dying patients, the conversations with their family members and listening to the same fear of death. I refer to this book all the time and it really transformed my relationship to living and dying, and how we humans frame it. From the minute we are born, we are dying. He puts dying in the centre and through his many conversations with the dying, and their loved ones, our greatest fear is being forgotten. That we cling on to life to stay a part of something, to stay important, the last hurrah of our ego. 

As we sit in the pandemic with panic and death edging towards our front doors, we will be called to embrace our relationship with dying and with grief.   
Stephen has written a blog about coronavirus too:   
_“Leaving the wishing, the hoping, out of it. That’s how you leave the panic out: By leaving the hope out, too. By being a citizen – not an inmate – of a troubled time_. “[Window](https://orphanwisdom.com/window/)"

### Our wise booklist 

With the time we have now, you can finally make a start on your ‘aspirational’ bookshelf, which if you are like me is full of the books I should read and haven’t made the time too. This [Wise booklist](https://artearthtech.com/2019/12/10/wise-booklist/) from our community is a good start, indeed I’m not sure many are left off!

# Online events

These days, we are gathering online instead of in person. Thankfully, many organisations have transferred their planned events to online. Here are a few happening over the next few weeks:

**27th - 29th March In Times of Crisis**: A two day course With Pat McCabe & Bayo Akomolafe from our friends Ruby and Christabel Reed at the fantastic Advaya Initiative

_"Covid-19, like any disruption, essentially confronts each of us with a choice: (1) to freeze, turn away from others, only care for ourselves, or (2) to turn toward others to support and comfort those who need help_." GAIA offers a 14 week process where you can book slots every day leading up to the Global Forum in July. It looks like a fun experiment to be part of! [https://www.presencing.org/news/news/gaia-global-activation-of-intention-and-action](https://www.presencing.org/news/news/gaia-global-activation-of-intention-and-action)

# Prayer 

**Prayer of Saint Francis of Assisi**

Mother/Lord, make me an instrument of thy peace!

That where there is hatred, I may bring love.

That where there is wrong, I may bring the spirit of forgiveness.

That where there is discord, I may bring harmony.

That where there is error, I may bring truth.

That where there is doubt, I may bring faith.

That where there is despair, I may bring hope.

That where there are shadows, I may bring light.

That where there is sadness, I may bring joy.

Mother/Lord, grant that I may seek rather to comfort, than to be comforted.

To understand, than to be understood.

To love, than to be loved.

For it is by self-forgetting that one finds.

It is by forgiving that one is forgiven.

It is by dying that one awakens to Eternal Life.

—Saint Francis of Assisi—
