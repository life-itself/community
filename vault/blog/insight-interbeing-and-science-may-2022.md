> _Humanity needs a kind of spirituality that we can all practice together. Dogmatism and fanaticism have been the cause of great separation and war. In the twenty-first century ... it will be possible to establish a cosmic religion based not on myth, belief, or dogma, but on evidence and the insight of interbeing."_
> 
> Thich Nhat Hanh

In this residency we look to take steps on the intrepid collective journey proposed above, while remaining humble. We will collaboratively explore how interbeing can be cultivated in a way that is supported by personal inquiry and science. The group living context of the Bergerac practice hub provides a perfect space to pursue insight into interbeing while leaving participants enough time to work remotely. We will also explore the potential and limitations for new science to support spiritual practice.

## Key Info

- **What**: A residency that allows us to collaboratively deepen our contemplative insight, particularly into interbeing, in a spirit of inquiry consistent with science.

## Overview

### Residency Structure

The residency will be structured around regular daily practices focusing on nature connection, and weekly workshops/seminars focusing on the development of an accessible eco-spirituality.

The exact structure is left deliberately somewhat open in order to adapt to need once the residency commences, but some of the core elements will include:

_Group Inquiry_: 3-4 evenings a week we will have a group practice or inquiry based around the topic above. The organisers have ideas, but participants are encouraged to make suggestions.

_Meals Together_: Lunch every weekday. Participants will come to an agreement together about dinner and weekend cooking arrangements.

_Daily practices_: meditation, and mindful working in groups to maintain the space and cook. These will typically be in the morning between 7:30 and 9:30. Early evening meditation sessions will also be held at a time agreed upon by the group.
