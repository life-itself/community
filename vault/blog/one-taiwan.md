The election just happened and revealed a gap in the value system between two generations.

How can we bring Taiwan back together after this election and celebrate the many faces of Taiwan?

Sylvie Shiwei Barbier will be performing a theatrical dialogue with the audience to open the space and go beyond identities, political views and generations. She breaks the usual rules of the separation between the artist and the audience. Art here functions to point to an ultimate dimension, from One Cosmos, to one earth to reveal the One Taiwan.

> _There is an essence in each of us, something that can not be broken, that can not die. Something that is eternal where all is one. My art is to bring that present to you._

**When: Thursday 27th February 18:00**

**Where: Acid Lab, Taipei, Taiwan**
