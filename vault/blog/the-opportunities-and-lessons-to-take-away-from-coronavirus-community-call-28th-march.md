Dear Art / Earth / Tech community,  
  
Aware of the recent coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak around the world, we would like to share a few reflections with you.   
  
It is important in these times to put things in perspective and to do that, let’s first breathe and find our calm.   
  
The Chinese word for crisis is composed of the word “Danger” and “Opportunity”. Right now, there is a lot of the conversation in the public space coming from a place of  “fear” and focused on the danger and disruption. Here, at Art/ Earth / Tech we would like to emphasize more the “Opportunity” – without in any way diminishing or denying the suffering arising for people – but focusing more on the lessons and reflection that we may take from it?  
  
This is a chance to reflect on our way of life and discover that we could live less busily and more humbly, spend more time with our family, play more with our children. An opportunity to look at our mortality and appreciate the preciousness of life and our loved ones  
  
This is our chance to show that we could live in a way that would limit emissions to 2 degrees C — and that it could even be weller and wiser. Yes, it would mean living more simply — and doing it without the lockdowns! – reflecting on what really matters and what makes us truly happy. If we can enjoy ourselves now, it shows we can enjoy meeting the emissions targets.  
  
Indeed, the Coronavirus shows us that we could meet the Paris agreement. This crisis could even be seen as a test drive before we are to face an even greater crisis: the climate one. In the space of a month we have seen our capability to act in spectacular ways when faced with the direct threat of death to our elderly and more vulnerable. We have shown that we can go beyond our political differences and act collectively on a global scale. This shows that change is possible.  
  
This is an opportunity to think, act and live with a more collective mindset, present to our interdependence. The Coronavirus gives us an opportunity to directly realise the consequences of our actions on each other at a global scale, an opportunity to dream of a different world where we relate to ourselves not as individuals but as in\[ter\]dividuals.  
  
It is a chance for us to get off the runaway train which risks leading humanity into an abyss. These past weeks have proven to us that we can not only survive without the futilities of modern life – the Zara clothes, the McDonalds. We can become present to the essential and look deeply, trust each other, our neighbours, and also our governments and institutions.   
  
So let’s dare to dream together and paint a new world, one where we trust and learn from the lessons the Coronavirus has to offer, come join us in our open Online Community day this coming **_[Saturday evening 28th March and 4th of April 6-8pm (CET) - 5-7pm (UK)](https://zoom.us/j/659327540)_**

In gratitude and service,
