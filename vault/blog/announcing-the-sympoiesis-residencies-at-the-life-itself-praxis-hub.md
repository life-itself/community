We're thrilled to annouce Life Itself's latest initiative: Sympoiesis.

Explore more conscious, collective ways of living in stunning surroundings near Bordeaux in France.

These are a series of experiential collective residencies at the Life Itself Praxis Hub in Bergerac. Residencies are an opportunity to explore the practices and social technologies for transforming our reactivity and learning to live and work together.

Each residency is a month long, the first starting in mid October 2021. Residencies combine both an activating frame of collective practices with the space for you to continue your daily work â€“ a key aspect of Sympoiesis is learning how we can integrate community and practice, collective and private, absolute and relative in our daily life.

**What:** Experiential collective residencies with the opportunity to explore practices and social technologies for transforming our reactivity and learning to work and live together.
