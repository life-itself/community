## **About Community Hangouts**

Systems change, culture development and community living are exciting and energising topics. We all sense that we need new structures and new being for this time of transition.

Our community hangouts are a place to share and reflect on the work you’re doing and to connect with others working on similar projects from around the world.

- Short welcome and getting to know each other
- Dialogue with our guest
- Open space for sharing projects, ideas and support

Participants are welcome to join for as little or as much of the hour as they would like.
