This week in the Exploring Social Transformation series of the Life Itself Podcast, we are sharing a conversation with acclaimed author of 'The Patterning Instinct' and 'The Web of Meaning', [Jeremy Lent](https://www.jeremylent.com/). This conversation was originally published in September 2021 as part of the [Imaginary Society Forum](https://untitled.community/events_n_programmes/imaginary-society/), a forum curated by Life Itself in association with Untitled for the exercising of social imagination through practice and theory.

In this episode, Jeremy and Rufus take apart the myth of man's innate selfishness and dig into how shifts in cultural consciousness have historically come about, what's coming next, and why we have reason to feel hopeful.
