This month's update from the Berlin Hub will be the first of many goodbyes and new welcomes - these updates will give an impression of how people who've lived here experienced their stay, and what the people joining (and re-joining) are looking forward to in the upcoming months. To not mesh together too many of these we'll start small.

One step at a time

## Farewell Amee

Amee stayed with us for close to a year, joining together with Jasper in September 2021 to live in the 2-people apartment in the back of the building. This year they were joined by a furry friend - Momo - who brightened up the hub with his playful nature.

To round things off I asked her to write a little something about her experience at the hub, her reasons to move on and her take on wisdom, which I would now like to share with you:

"Living at the hub was an entirely new experience for me. I had lived in shared spaces many times in my life, but only until the Hub was there an intentional aspect to living together. I enjoyed many of our practices and really getting to know the amazing people that live there. Everyone is so different and the diversity is super comforting because it makes you feel like anyone can fit in.

  
Of course there are times when I did not have the mental or practical space for community events outside of weekly practice. I felt like others were also in the same situation and could take a step back as long as they voiced this intention. Everyone was respecting of these types of personal/mental health boundaries.

  
After having lived with the community for almost a year, I feel like I learned a lot about myself in respect to being a community member. I felt like I was able to learn things about other community members in very special ways through each practice being led by a different member, and I continue to value those connections. Everyone is so helpful and giving in different ways, and I am so grateful to have shared the space with inwardly beautiful people.  
  
To me, living together wisely is about the differences, that through communicating (with words and actions) we come to a common understanding and grow, together."

Thank you Amee for your calmness, care, contributions and the joy you brought to the people here at the hub. We wish you all the best moving forward in life - may you take the seeds of wisdom that you hopefully discovered for yourself at the Berlin Hub and sow them in the world.

More goodbyes, but also new hellos are to follow.

We wish you a lovely day and much wisdom in the relationships with the people in your lives!

With love,

the Berlin Hub
