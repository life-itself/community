In 2016, Rufus put together some initial into the modern trend of Coliving. See below for helpful information on the topic:

- [OpenDoor.io](http://opendoor.io/)
    - Corp structure: privately owned, equity investors.
    - Founders: Jay Standish, Ben Provan
    - 3 spaces: Farmhouse (2014, 16 residents (?)), Euclid Manor (2016, 11), The Canopy (March 2015, 12)
    - Tagline: Live better together
    - San Francisco (area)
    - Summary:
    - Since time immemorial, humans have lived in tribes, clans, and villages. We are a social species and community is our natural habitat. Coliving is nothing new - it’s simply a modern way of living well together.We see coliving as a platform for your life. For becoming your best self by being part of something bigger. For sharing space, skills, resources and dreams with other inspiring and creative people. For living a life on purpose.
- Common
    - Brooklyn
    - Brad Hargreaves
    - $1800 per week+
- WeLive (WeWork)
    - Launched in 2017
    - Also trying to break into co-living is WeWork, the staggeringly valued property manager. The landlord to a new generation of tech startups (and the Guardian’s New York office) is hoping to justify its $16bn valuation by making it big in co-living with WeLive. Their model – call it dorm 2.0 – is to rent space from a landlord, convert it to cookie-cutter bedrooms that come with access to shared common space – to foster a feeling of community – and rent them out to members on a month-to-month basis.

    - Our new development at Old Oak Common is the first example of our pioneering Co-Living concept, offering its members a brand new way to live in London.
        - CO-LIVING IS A NEW WAY TO LIVE: Co-living is a way of living focused on a genuine sense of community, using shared spaces and facilities to create a more convenient and fulfilling lifestyle. - [https://www.thecollective.co.uk/coliving](https://www.thecollective.co.uk/coliving)
        - From the FAQ:
        - What is Co-living? Co-living is a new way of living inspired by the old, with community and collective experiences at its core. Starting with the basics, it offers shared spaces such as a bar, restaurant, gym, library, laundry, roof terraces, hot desks and more. Using this space to bring everyone together, we are creating collaborative and fun environments that expose members to new people, new ideas and new experiences.
    - Size: 500+ rooms (!). Fully serviced. 546 people across 10 floors.
    - Price: £200-£330 a week (min 9m tenancies)
- [coliving.org](http://coliving.org/) lists a bunch of place
    - mostly very small and the map seems a bit limited (not sure up to date etc)
    - Interesting definition:
        - Shared housing designed to support a purpose-driven life.
        - A modern, urban lifestyle that values openness, sharing, and collaboration.Synonyms: intentional living, intentional community, cohousing, modern nomad.

## **Stats**

The number of 18- to 35-year-olds living with roommates has doubled since 1980.[1](https://www.theguardian.com/business/2016/mar/20/co-living-companies-reinventing-roommates-open-door-common-)

## **Trends**

- People marry / in partnerships later in life. They are also having children later.
- Growth of cities esp “hot” cities - more people who want to live there, and more expensive => shared space is efficient
- Interest in “living together”
    - more lonely society, fewer community activities, usually have moved away from family and roots etc
    - interest in different ways of being and connecting with others
- Growth of the “networked” society: more fluid jobs, more complex interconnected social and economic networks
- Nomadism: people move around for work, work is virtual, air travel is cheap. People want to rent (note most of this “coliving” is rental based - tenants do not own and are not that related to the owners esp in e.g. welive case).
