## **About Community Hangouts**

We all sense that we need new structures and new being for this time of transition. Our community hangouts are a place to share and reflect on the work you’re doing and to connect with others working on similar projects from around the world.

- Short welcome and getting to know each other
- Dialogue with our guest
- Open space for sharing projects, ideas and support

Participants are welcome to join for as little or as much of the hour as they would like.

## **About Esther**

![](/assets/images/esther-headshot-trees.jpg)

Esther has spent more than twenty years learning and sharing about the conditions that help humans beings to grow from their natural inner wisdom, rooted in themselves and in harmony with others. She has travelled around the world seeking cultures and communities in order to enrich her vision for the wiser nurturing and education of children.

The source that has helped her the most have been the projects that Mauricio and Rebeca Wild created in Ecuador, where she trained for several years over the course of several long-term visits.

She has started her own school and her own community and now she is coaching families, teacher's and organizing conscious parenting retreats as well as retreats for adults in nature.

The past six years she has also been deeply involved in the children's program for the summer retreat in Plum Village where she has also been in charge for the school for parents.

Finally, she is the mother of two wonderful children of twenty and eighteen.
