Welcome to our latest monthly update! June has been pretty glorious here in the south of France; we've been soaking up the sun on the banks of the Dordogne, jumping into its sparkling blue waters to cool off, and planning a total of five residencies so you can come enjoy it too!

In this month's newsletter we'll tell you all you need to know about our upcoming residencies, as well as update you on everything else we've been up to - including the launch of a brand new podcast series! We hope you enjoy and, as ever, please do [get in touch](https://lifeitself.org/contact/) with any questions, comments or just to say hi; we love hearing from you üíõ

## Fancy a spontaneous summer getaway?

### July 2022: Open Residency

We've got some last minute spots available on our Open Residency! If you fancy an impromptu trip away for some summer sun and community living, we've got just the thing.

**What:** Experience a taste of life and belonging in a co-created community of practice. You will have time to devote to personal work or projects in a setting conducive to inspiration. In a lighter format than the Sympoiesis residencies, this proposal aims to combine practice, work, and well-being in a beautiful riverside setting in southwest France.

**When:** Running until July 20th 2022 (Participants are flexible to arrive and leave at any point. Monthly, weekly, and nightly fees found [here](https://lifeitself.org/open-residency/)).

**Where:** [Life Itself Praxis Hub, Bergerac](https://lifeitself.org/hubs/bergerac/), France (near Bordeaux)

## Upcoming Residencies & Retreats

### August 2022: Light, Shadow, Integration

How do we acknowledge our culture‚Äôs overrating of thought and theory, and the associated trauma, without getting caught in anti-thought and delusion (which are thoughts)? How do we discuss all the stuff that fills our heads without re-traumatising ourselves?

**What:** This residency will concentrate on enjoying presence and embodiment while playfully and lovingly dwelling with ‚Äúspiritual‚Äù shadows ‚Äì new dogmas or prides of a budding culture. Participants will be invited to bring their own practices, experiments and works, embodied or intellectual, into the open space, suggesting activities and co-creating our exploration. All activities will be optional and we will have time for our own work.

**When:** August 1st ‚Äì 29th, 2022

**Where:** [Life Itself Praxis Hub, Bergerac](https://lifeitself.org/hubs/bergerac/), France (near Bordeaux)

**With:** [Liam Kavanagh](https://lifeitself.org/people/)

### Sep-Dec 2022: Embodying Collective Transformation

Sharing personal and collective practices to address the challenges of our time and help create a world that works for all life.

**What:** A series of three one-month-long residencies consisting of a seven-day intensive training in personal and group practices for courageous collective transformation, followed by a three-week community immersion to integrate and deepen these practices in our daily lives. The immersion includes time and space for you to continue your daily personal work and projects. Apply to attend just the week-long training, the entire month-long residency, or multiple months of residency.

**When:** September 2nd-30th; October 1st-30th; November 1st-30th

**Where:** [Life Itself Praxis Hub, Bergerac](https://lifeitself.org/hubs/bergerac/), France (near Bordeaux)

We are very excited to announce the launch of the newest series of the Life Itself Podcast, 'Exploring Social Transformation'.

In this series, we are exploring the emerging ecosystem of alternative approaches to social change. Our aim for the podcast is to uncover the different approaches to social change active within this ecosystem, to inform our listeners, connect pioneers and to more broadly facilitate a thorough and rigorous investigation into such an exciting and important network of radical change-makers. Head over to our YouTube channel or your favourite podcast platform to catch up on the four episodes already available.

## Ecosystem Mapping Update

![](/assets/images/Screenshot-2022-06-09-at-14.51.41-1-1024x531.png)

Our project to map the [emerging ecosystem](https://ecosystem.lifeitself.org/) centered on a radical, alternative approach to social change has been met with great enthusiasm and interest. We‚Äôve been excited to receive comments, feedback, and offers to help. We are now working on making it even easier for people to contribute to mapping and building awareness of this ecosystem. Stay tuned! Please feel free to drop us a line if you feel moved to contribute; we look forward to discussing.

If you feel like you would benefit from the support of Life Itself Labs, either around mapping, research and sensemaking or the design of innovative economic and governance models then please don‚Äôt hesitate to [get in touch](https://lifeitself.org/contact/), and one of our team will be happy to have an introductory call.

## Update from the Berlin Hub

"Setting up an international community in the middle of a building housing many locals has the potential to become the very embodiment of gentrification. Predominantly young, international people, working in jobs that didn‚Äôt exist 10 years ago, living like a foreign organ in a body that had seemingly grown organically before.

But does it have to be like that? And if not ‚Äì how to avoid that?

I believe the answer is connection...."
