We can learn to offer the Love that heals and help children to feel unique and content within so they can be authentically rooted and truly peaceful and happy.¬†

How to be with our children to keep watering their natural joy, peace, curiosity, self confidence, concentration, will, and find healthy relationships that help them to overcome boredom, dispersion, need of external recognition, approval or entertainment ...¬†

## About Esther

![](/assets/images/esther-headshot-trees.jpg)

Esther has spent more than twenty years learning and sharing about the conditions that help humans beings to grow from their natural inner wisdom, rooted in themselves and in harmony with others.¬†She has travelled around the world seeking cultures and communities in order to enrich her vision for the wiser nurturing and education of children.

The source that has helped her the most have been the projects that Mauricio and Rebeca Wild created in Ecuador, where she trained for several years over the course of several long-term visits.

She has started her own school and her own community and now she is coaching families, teacher's and organizing conscious parenting retreats as well as retreats for adults in nature.

The past six years she has also been deeply involved in the children's program for the summer retreat in Plum Village where she has also been in charge for the school for parents.

Finally, she is the mother of two wonderful children of twenty and eighteen.
