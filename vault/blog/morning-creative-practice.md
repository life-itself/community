Why does art and creativity matter? Well it is your expression, the one which is unique to you. It is a way of making sense of the world and your life, to integrate different parts of yourself and express them. Our Morning Creative Practice calls are here so we make time to develop our artistic side and explore the depth of our humanity.

_"These weekly sessions helped to awaken my imagination in work and everyday life, and to deepen my connection with creative parts of myself that have been dormant."_

**What will I get out of the call?**

"_I would highly recommend these calls for those who are looking for ways to express themselves, creative motivation and connection with others. I felt truly inspired and challenged by each session. My mind, body and soul were nourished by the creative practices."_

Creativity is like a muscle, the more you practice the stronger it gets. You get to be more intune with yourself and your intuition. You will be part of a Whatsapp group in which you will get to share your art practice. Our community provides support and helps you with motivation, since one of the hardest things is to keep yourself motivated in your creative practice when you are alone. Morning is the best time to activate your right brain, so you will continue your day being more in the flow. Here are some of the practices we will do:

Collages

Spontaneous Writing

Creative Contemplation

Rituals

Here at Art / Earth / Tech we value Art, as we see it as a profound expression of our humanity and access to our sense of oneness. The call will be led by Sylvie Barbier, performance artist and co-founder of Art / Earth / Tech. 

Our creative side is so precious so let’s make time for it. **Join our Morning Creative Practices calls with Sylvie Barbier every **Thursday** 7:30am (UK). Book yourself for £35.**
