There’s not really an established term yet for the kind of way of living that we imagine and seek to pioneer. We've come to call it **"conscious coliving"** reflecting the fusion of two related practices: **conscious living** and **coliving**.

Here we want to say a bit more about what we mean by conscious co-living as well as frame within it within the broader space of co-living and intentional communities.

## **Conscious living**

For us, conscious living has two complementary components:

- An active engagement with inner development whether in a spiritual or secular form.
- An explicit awareness of one’s impact on others and the planet

## **Coliving**

Modern coliving is where people live together with varying degrees of integration and shared space.

This covers the broad spectrum of co-living models, from one where all space is held in common to one where everyone has their own private, personal dwelling along with some shared communal spaces such as a kitchen or a dining area. It can also range from a fully residential model to short-term retreat style approach and much in between.

One important point for us, is that we see co-living as not simply being an economic convenience but involving an active commitment to fostering community.

## Conscious living and coliving are complements

We also see these two aspect of conscious co-living as complementary and synergistic. That is, conscious living supports co-living and co-living supports conscious living.

### Conscious living supports coliving

First, conscious living provides essential psycho-social foundations on which to build thriving co-living, especially in the long-term. It does so by helping us deal with the challenges that can arise when we live with others. Whilst co-living brings many benefits it also inevitably brings up frictions -- who accidentally threw out my leftovers from fridge, who is playing their music too loud etc.

### Coliving supports conscious living

Coliving supports conscious living on three levels.

First, living in a community is often a key aspect of sustained engagement with the work of inner development (e.g. it's easier to meditate when others meditate).

Second, coliving within a strong community provides connection and support that helps us pursue our true wants and dreams.

Third, coliving is a way for us to live more lightly on the planet thus economising our use of resources.

### Intentional Communities

An intentional community is "a group of people who have chosen to live together with a common purpose, working cooperatively to create a lifestyle that reflects their shared core values." \[From _[Creating a Life Together](https://lifeitself.org/2021/05/14/notes-on-creating-a-life-together-by-diana-leafe-christian/)_\]

### The Conscious Coliving Manifesto

It is essential to reference the [Conscious Coliving](https://www.consciouscoliving.com) project and their [manifesto](https://www.consciouscoliving.com/the-manifesto/). This is a great piece of work and we think the manifesto and the definition here are closely aligned. The alignment is not entirely surprising: the Conscious Coliving team are close friends of ours and we contributed to the original version of the manifesto which was developed at a Life Itself sprint back in 2017!
