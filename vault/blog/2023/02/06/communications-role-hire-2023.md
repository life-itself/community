## Types of work  
  
Some examples of the responsibilities you may take on as part of your role include:  
  
* Writing and editing copy for our website, blog and newsletter  
* Managing and growing our social media  
* Managing our growing podcast and youtube  
* Creating entire new campaigns based on specific themes e.g. conscious coliving, integral inner development etc  
* Managing engagement with external parties e.g. reaching out to respected thinkers to ask them to speak at events, managing our email ‘front door'  
* Researching and connecting with other social initiatives  
  
We can flex the scope of the role for a range of experience and skill and time: we have both more basic tasks around social media management and the need to design entire campaigns if you have the capacity and aspiration.  
  
One thing is essential: being a self-starter who is able to take initiative and self-manage tasks and deliverables.

We are a small team organized on “teal”, agile principles. All team members contribute to a diverse range of projects, so whatever your current skills set you will be in an environment that provides many opportunities for growth.  
  
Our work is also embedded in a context of ideas, practices and initiatives which mean there is a high degree of learning potential.
