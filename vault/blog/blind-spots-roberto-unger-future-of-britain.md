Blind Spots is [our new series of conferences](https://artearthtech.com/institute/blind-spots/) exploring the collective blind spots of our society.

What is holding us back from creating a powerful and inspiring vision for our future? Why do we seem stuck in making minor upgrades to managerial capitalism?

For our first event on Sunday 17th March, held with the Institute for Public Policy Research, we are excited to welcome [Professor Roberto Unger](http://www.robertounger.com/en/) of Harvard Law School. One of the youngest law professors in Harvard’s history at 29, he played a significant role in bringing democracy back to Brazil, served in Lula’s government as a minister and has been called “a prophet” by the famed philosopher Richard Rorty. A key influence and inspiration to Obama he was also one of Obama’s toughest critics, memorably arguing against Obama’s second term.

Unger is the author of several important and groundbreaking works, most recently “The Future of American Progressivism” and “The Knowledge Economy”. For decades, he has been a [pragmatic utopian](https://artearthtech.com/2017/10/20/pragmatic-utopians/), working to envision a practical path to a radically better future at a time when such political dreams were unfashionable. An outspoken critic of neoliberalism and a prophet before his time, he early identified the ideological bankruptcy of managerial capitalism. Now, at a time when history seems to be proving him right, we should learn all what we can from this pioneering voice.

At Art / Earth / Tech we believe that it is crucial to engage in big conversations to examine what is in our way as a society and how we can create a big vision for our future and act powerfully on it.

The conference will be facilitated by our co-founder Dr Rufus Pollock, economist, technologist and author of the [Open Revolution](https://openrevolution.net/) and co-founder Dr Liam Kavanagh cognitive scientist and Director of the Art / Earth / Tech institute.

The Event will take place on **Sunday the 17th of March 4-6pm at Newspeak House, 133 Bethnal Green Road, London E2 7DG.**

Come join us for two hours of intellectual discovery where we travel with our minds to place we usually never go and discover our collective blind spots.
