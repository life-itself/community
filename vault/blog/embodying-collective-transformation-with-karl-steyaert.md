In the second episode of our Exploring Social Transformation series, Theo Cox sits down with visionary cultural catalyst, Karl Steyaert. Karl explains what it is to be a 'Champion of Human Wholeness', why inner transformation is central to wider societal transformation, and tells us about the series of residencies he will be facilitating in the Life Itself Bergerac Hub from September-November 2022.

## Embodying Collective Transformation Community Residencies

_Sharing personal and collective practices to address the challenges of our time and help create a world that works for all life_

We are thrilled to have Karl co-facilitate three one-month long residencies this autumn in the Life Itself Bergerac hub. These ‘Embodying Collective Transformation’ residencies will consist of a week of intensive training in personal and group practices for courageous collective transformation, followed by three weeks of community immersion to integrate and deepen these practices in our daily lives. The immersion includes time and space for you to continue your daily personal work and projects. People can apply to attend just the week-long training, the entire month-long residency, or multiple months of residency.

### Why?

We’re passionate about coming together with others to embody the necessary personal and collective practices to address the challenges of our time and help create a world that works for all life. Nothing compares to spending time living in a community of people dedicated to evolution and service. And, in our experience, nothing is as fulfilling!

### When?

Sep 2nd-30th; Oct 1st – 30th; Nov 1st – 30th 2022
