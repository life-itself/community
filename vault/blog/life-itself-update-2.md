## 18th June - 15th July

Time for another update on some of the things we're most excited about from our recent sprints. Last month the headquarters of Life Itself moved from La Cheraille to our beautiful new farmhouse in Bergerac. Rufus, Sylvie, Will and Bethany managed the mammoth task of packing and moving everything from La Cheraille in just two days.

Will, one of our newer team members, was visiting the hub to co-work with Rufus and Sylvie. You might have noticed the excellent updates Will has made to our offerings pages; if you haven't attended one of our online calls yet, visit our [calls page](https://lifeitself.org/calls/) to become part of a wonderful community supporting each other to grow, get s\*\*\* done, have transformative insights and develop or deepen creative practices.

We've also been busy organising the building festival at Bergerac, which will run from Monday 3rd â€“ Sunday 30th August. We'll be transforming the farmhouse into a vibrant community space by revitalising the living areas, event spaces and gardens. If you haven't already [booked a ticket](https://ti.to/art-earth-tech/bergerac-build-festival), there's still time! The festival is free to attend and includes free meals and a camping ground with shower facilities.

Volunteers at the festival will spend four hours each day building and bringing the hub to life. The rest of the time might include swimming in the Dordogne river (just a short drive from the farmhouse), participating in workshops, taking part in communal cooking and exploring the surrounding countryside. You can come for any amount of time to build, relax, make meaningful connections and enjoy the beautiful surroundings.

During the pandemic it's been more important than ever for teams to have a supportive structure and sense of community. Petro and Sylvie have been continuing and expanding our organisation consulting this month, supporting the cultural development of organisations to increase teams' connectedness, focus and clarity.

We're also delighted to be curating and hosting the Untitled Imaginary Society forum, which will welcoming the multidisciplinary artist duo [VestandPage](https://www.vest-and-page.de) on the 3rd September.

VestandPage will lead an evening called ['Changing the Gaze: Moving beyond anthropocentric imaginaries'](https://untitled.community/events/imaginary-society/) during which they will share their artistic and poetic practices. There will also be breakout discussions in the group to explore the possibilities their work inspires for how we can listen, see and imagine differently to move beyond an anthropocentric view.

This month Liam has been working on setting up events around his work on 'The Equality Complex.' The highlight for him has been running an event inquiring into the role of equality in morality and culture, whether moralistic judgement of others has become a replacement for love in pursuing a better world, and whether this is truly the way to justice. If you missed it, you can still watch [a recording of the event](https://lifeitself.org/2020/07/14/the-equality-complex-sunday-salon-19th-july-2020-3pm/?fbclid=IwAR0Z3Dya3gfpSMthDjFWt173QO3DRnU1tFn0UnBSrvo-wIF30we6m2P086U). Liam is running a followup event on skillful communication and 'cancel culture,' so keep an eye on our site to book a place in the near future!
