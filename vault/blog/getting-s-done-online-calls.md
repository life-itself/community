Good morning everybody!

Maybe there are projects you always wanted to do but never got around to it. Maybe you tend to procrastinate and overthink things. Maybe sometimes you just need to talk to someone so you can get your juices flowing! Well the Get S\*\*\* Done call is for you! You can benefit from our practices if you are doing a massive spring clean or delivering a project to a client. This call is open for all from teachers to musicians, to engineers and business owners. 

**Join our Getting S\*\*\* Done calls, every weekday morning for 25 minutes from Monday 13th of April at 8:30am (UK) for 3 weeks with your host Petronella @Art Earth Tech.**

**Book yourself for £20 and GET ALL YOUR MONEY BACK at the end if you attend 90% of the calls.**

**How do these calls work?** 

You will be part of a WhatsApp group, where you get to write up what you have accomplished in the last 24 hours, what your game is to achieve and do in the next 24 hours, and what you may be blocked with.  This is where being part of a community who has your back helps. 

Life has always been uncertain, yet having practices and people around help us accomplish what we want. 

**What do I get out of these calls?**

Our community provides support and accountability which produces powerful results (and better than going at it alone). This is a practice we have tested ourselves internally for several years and it works. Which is why we want to offer it to our broader community. Here are some additional things that will get covered:

- Self motivation and self management
- Accountability
- Validation exercise
- Integrity

**Get S\*\*\* Done Culture of Art / Earth / Tech**

Part of creating a wiser world we all want to live in, is in the way we are being _and_ getting s\*\*\* done. Art Earth Tech would not exist if it were not for us waking up with a possibility and getting the legwork done. We’re doers as well as thinkers and meditators. We value hard work, commitment, shipping, and getting sh\*\* done. So we can’t wait to be on the call with y’all and share this practice with you. Who’s in?! 

**Join our morning calls at 8:30am - 8:55am (UK) on Getting S\*\*\* Done.** 

Every weekday for 30min from Monday 13th April to Friday 1st May with your host Petronella @Art Earth Tech. ****Book yourself for £20 and GET ALL YOUR MONEY BACK at the end if you attend 90% of the calls.****
