Every Wednesday in November 2019 our London member Ayesha is leading her **‘Walking Wise’ walks** in London, applying her work in rural wilderness to the urban wilderness. Come, unwind and explore the magic and mystery of our inner city streets with us.

About Ayesha:  
_“I’m currently creating new outdoor workshops that promote spontaneity and playfulness, whilst also learning more about healing through nature. Alongside this I’m getting creative with inclusion projects and continuing with inspirational writings. I’m involved in outdoor education projects and camps, and want to continue to work within the outdoor setting as a way of exploration, nature based learning and connection with land. During my MA there was a strong focus on community, integration and recognition of those who are under-represented in society. I continue to support community/environmental projects that are reaching out and empowering.”_

Meet 3pm Hoxton Overground station. To book, please contact Ayesha at Ayeshabhatti33@outlook.com / 07970 103025
