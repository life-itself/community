Take time to unwind on a Sunday afternoon whilst someone shares with you what has captured their imagination. From fermenting kimchi through heartbreak, to social and cultural implications of AI. Our community is rich with gems, masters and mistresses of all sorts of skills and knowledge, and this is an opportunity to listen and learn from their passion.

Sunday 19th July: **'The Equality Complex' with Dr Liam Kavanagh**

### **How do these salons work?**

On the last Sunday of the month, we open our doors to those in our community who have something to teach us, from knowledge to new skills. As a listener, you simply need to log on to the call and the session will be led first by the guest host, and then with a discussion afterwards. If you would like to host one of these sessions and lead a salon, email events@artearthtech.comÂ and they will arrange this with you.

### **What do I get out of these salons?**

Our community is vibrant with expertise in many fields under a commonality that is: a wiser way of being, and how to generate that in the world today. You get to learn from these experts and be part of a community that values rigour and expertise, knowledge sharing and craftsmanship.

### **Why Art / Earth / Tech value this practice** 

As a community we are nothing without the people who make up the community - from different fields, cultures and ages. As you know from our Gatherings, our team and collaborations, AET is multidisciplinary and is nourished by our differences and edges.

**Here are the times and dates of the salons**:

28th June: **'Networks of Socio-Ecological Resiliency'** with Rory Egan Curtin 2-4pm BST; 3-5pm CST

12th July: 'The Equality Complex' with Dr Liam Kavanagh 2-4pm BST; 3-5pm CST
