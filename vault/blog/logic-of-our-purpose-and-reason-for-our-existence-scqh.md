Slides presented at the Art / Earth / Tech (Life Itself) sprint on 12 April 2017. This reflects early thinking on a more detailed explanation of purpose of Life Itself and the logic for its existence. Note these are my personal views and may not reflect those of everyone else!

## Sketches of a Future Society - 12 April 2017 @ La Cheraille

* * *

## Why? Why What?

Why Art / Earth / Tech?

This will take us on a much deeper journey

* * *

## Asking Good Questions

SCQA = Situation, Complication, Question, Answer

* * *

## Situation

We've never had it so good!

Things have got a lot better materially and science and technology mean we know a lot more about the material world

- A good portion of humanity no longer want for food or shelter.
- Consequence of dramatic material and technological growth of the last few centuries

* * *

## Complication

But we're still not that well/happy. Plus, progress is very unevenly distributed and we may even be going backwards (global warming, inequality etc)

* * *

- Many remain poor and without basic security of sustenance or thought
- Benefits of material abundance for the well-off seem relatively meagre -- the Buddhist monk is happier than the billionaire
- Greater wealth and power has not come with greater wisdom. Our errors now play out on a larger scale -- from aggression exaggerated by biological and nuclear weapons to the tragedy of commons threatening the entire biosphere.
- Things may even be going backwards: ecological damage, inequality, decline of community etc
    - though one must always be sceptical -- "everything has been going to the dogs" is an old complaint

* * *

## Complication II

Additionally: "end of vision / end of hope / end of utopia" -- many traditional sources of hope for progress seem to have faded whether in religion and politics:

* * *

- Decline of hopeful religion ~150y - death of god
- Decline of hopeful politics ~30-40y - death of socialism
    - Politics reduced to managerialism for growth (but growth of what)
    - Postmodern disdain for vision and values (just leave me alone to choose, triumph of the "dispassionate" market)
    - Resurgence of a "selfish", resentful rightwing

* * *

## Question

- Why is this? Specifically:
    - If you're so rich, why aren't you so happy ...?
    - Why can't we cooperate better
- And: What is to be done?
    - Is there a powerful, unifying vision for humanity -- both personally "the good life", and societally "the good society"?
    - How would we achieve that?
        - What is our theory of change?
        - How do we get started?

* * *

## Summary

- Situation: You've never had it so good!
- Complication: But we're still not that well/happy. Plus, progress is unevenly distributed and we may even be going backwards
- Complication II: death of god, death of socialism aka "end of utopia" -- many traditional sources of hope for progress have faded whether in religion or politics
- Question: Why is this? What and How: What is to be done?

* * *

## Why?

Spiritual version: We are all Buddha, but our minds are encrusted with delusion, hatred and anger.

Scientific version: evolution did not select for wellness or wisdom, but for survival fitness. Extraordinarily, and accidentally, we ended up with consciousness, self-reflection and enough cognitive capacity to develop language, culture and complex abstract thought -- and meditation.

* * *

## Why II

- lot of stuff encrusts our mind that is tough to remove
    - impulsivity (thinking fast), heuristics, envy etc
    - illusion of self distinct from others, that "I" am my thoughts etc => attachment to views (I'm right, you're wrong e.g. I'm a man, you're a woman so I'm better than you; I'm white, you're black etc)

* * *

## Why IIB

- Plus: all the errors of language and culture (erroneous but self-reinforcing (bad equilibrium)
    - e.g. institutionalized patriarchy
    - ritualized warfare
    - guilds
    - wearing suits

* * *

## Why III

4 kinds of problems

- Problems of science
- Problems of self knowledge
- Problems of self control
- Problems of the collective

All our techno-scientific advance in recent centuries has only helped with first one.

* * *

## What

Transformation of being

- Wellness ourselves
- Solve: collective action problems etc

But society/culture helps create being. + Material sustenance matters.

So transformation of being requires transformation of society.

* * *

## What II - The Good Life

Yes, I believe there is a powerful unifying vision for humanity.

A. High level ends: Joy, freedom, love, wisdom, creativity, balance, peace, contribution ... B. Conditions for that -- as well!

Buddhism -- 4NT. Basically correct.

However, for reasons just discussed this is hard individually.

* * *

## What IIB

Second, hard culturally since a variety of successful, maladaptive cultures e.g. competitive, individualistic, capitalism.

* * *

## How

* * *

## Two Arms of Transformation

* * *

## Culture and Ecosystem

A sustainable cultural ecosystem depends on a well-functioning (and interdependent) material and spiritual economies (spiritual = being, emotion, consciousness -- nothing specifically religious)

![](assets/images/image-1.png)

* * *

## Culture

To realise a wiser, weller world requires:

**A Culture**

- Personally: a self-sustaining community that support self-development and material sustenance => a culture
- Societally: a self-sustaining group dedicated to bringing about change on a long-term basis with a clear vision and strong values (resistance to corruption) => a culture

## Culture

- Values (and Vision)
- Norms
- Behaviours

Sketches of a Future Society => detailed picture of what this looks like.

* * *

## Life Itself (Art / Earth / Tech)

We are such a community.

- Being: living well and wise lives ourselves, developing our being
- Research: work out where we need to go (in detail) and how to get there
- Business: making a living, generating resources for investment
- Politics: (not necessarily electoral) structured effort to effect change in the collective

Part of wisdom is to avoid sacrificing means to ends. Thus all activities are themselves part of the practice.

* * *

## Conclusion

* * *

## Summary

- Need for change
- Deep transformation needed
- Opportunity
- Culture
- Art Earth Tech

* * *

## Opportunity / Context

Metaphor of scientific revolution

... and possibility of psychic revolution

## FAQ

- What's new about us? (aka hasn't this been done before?)
