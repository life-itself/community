Sometimes we want to connect and be connected. To be listened to, to listen to others and receive their 'good medicine' through their shares. These circles are held where people feel safe to openly share what is going on for them: it may be an insight you had this week, a breakthrough, a part of your story.

**What:** A small circle of people where you get to share what brought you here. You'll have 5 minutes to share uninterrupted and without judgment whilst the circle listens. If you request coaching, people can arrange that off the call.

**Why:** We often presume that it is difficult to connect with new people. The connection here is enabled with simple fun exercises that allow us to get to know each other, from the comfort of our home.

**How:** An online call for 45 minutes every week

**When:** Every Monday from 6:30-7:15pm UK for 8 weeks: 1st June - 25th July 2020

**Price:** £40 (£5 a session)

### **How do these calls work?** 

For 45 minutes every Monday for eight weeks, you will sit in a small circle of  8-10 people on Zoom. You will be invited to share “what brought you to where you are now”, uninterrupted by questions. These will be hosted by trained facilitator Petronella Tyson.

### **What do I get out of these circles?**

You get to know and discover parts of yourself, but more than that you get to be heard by a group of people and have that sense of connection with people on a weekly basis. You will also learn and practice communication skills in listening, sharing, and being authentic for other people.

After eight years working in distributed teams, living away from friends and family, I have found ways to bridge vulnerability, connection and shared joy. Sharing our stories and reflections are what helps us connect and grow. They are fundamental to community and relationship.

**Join a sharing circle every Monday 6:30-7:15pm for 8 weeks with your host Petronella @Art Earth Tech. £40 for the course of 8 sessions.**

### **  
Why Art / Earth / Tech value this practice**

For three years, Art Earth Tech has run family calls: pods of 7-8 people who meet regularly every two weeks to check-in with each other, and be reminded why they are part of Art Earth Tech, what community is for them and regenerate their possibility for the next two weeks. We have now evolved our Family Call practice with sharing circles open to everyone - no matter your geography. Stories are at the heart of how we understand ourselves, each other, and connect as a community. 

Come and find out for yourself.

**Petronella** is a trained facilitator, community practitioner and Doula. She has twelve years experience working in communities and is passionate that they are the place for transformation and wellbeing. In order for a community to flourish, it requires us to get clear on what’s going on inside us. [www.petronellatyson.com](http://www.petronellatyson.com)
