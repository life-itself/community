Over the past few months we have been sharing episodes centered around the theme of 'social transformation'. In this final episode of the mini-series, co-hosts Eilidh Ross, Theo Cox and Nathen Fitchen reflect on the series, sharing why we embarked on this project, our stand out moments, and key takeaways.

We will be continuing our exploration of this emerging ecosystem of radical change makers in the near future, so make sure to [sign up to our mailing list](https://lifeitself.org/contact/) to be kept up to date with new episodes, event announcements and more.
