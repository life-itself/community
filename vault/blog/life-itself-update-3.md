## July 16th - August 12th

The renovation of the Bergerac Hub began in earnest last month and we were delighted to welcome many new as well as familiar faces to the Building Festival.

Heavy building work was balanced with contemplation and interesting discussions. We began stripping the cement off the farmhouse's walls to reveal the beautiful stone walls underneath, did yoga together every morning in the shade of the trees, and relaxed by the Dordogne river. We held a Quaker meeting and a Plum Village Sharing Circle in which we shared joys and difficulties encountered in our meditation practices.

We were also delighted to welcome Simran and Elisa to the team.

Simran jumped straight into the role of the festival producer and helped make the building festival a huge success, in addition to teaching us yoga every morning.

Elisa is currently leading a research project on the emerging field of 'culture-making' in order to learn more about the individuals and organisations focused on improving the world through shaping culture. If you work in this space and would like to contribute to our understanding, please take a look at Elisa's [blog post](https://lifeitself.org/2020/08/27/our-expedition-to-explore-the-new-land-of-culture-making/) for more information and to get in touch.

We're looking forward to publishing some other exciting work. We'll soon be releasing _Collective Wisdom_, a book written by Liam Kavanagh, Director of our Research Institute, on the blindspots in Western culture that we urgently need to address if we are to avoid ecological and political crises. [Sign up](https://lifeitself.org/collective-wisdom/) to be notified when the book is released.

We're also making progress on [Wiser](https://lifeitself.org/wiser/), a newsletter that will provide curated information on how to live a wiser life.

You can now read about more of our work and projects on our website. If you're an investor interested in getting involved, check out the information about our [Real Estate Fund](https://lifeitself.org/real-estate-fund/), a fund to support the creation of more Life Itself co-living communities.
