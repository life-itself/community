Welcome to our July update! The past month has been one of lots of behind the scenes work: preparing our upcoming residencies, refactoring our web3 guide, and contemplating and developing an exciting new project. So lots to be keeping an eye out for over the next few months!

The [Bergerac Hub](https://lifeitself.org/hubs/bergerac/) hosted an Open Residency in June/July. Summer by the Dordogne provided the perfect backdrop for a relaxed, "Minimum Viable Practices" residency. Life Itself's Summer Gathering is currently taking place in the Bergerac Hub, with both core team members and members of the wider community coming together to connect and create.

We hope to have you join us out at our beautiful Bergerac Hub sometime soon, but in the meantime, we invite you to keep up to date with what we're up to by subscribing to our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCmBq3VO9w_MLTKD_CHsYN-Q), listening to the [Life Itself Podcast](https://anchor.fm/life-itself), following us on [social media](https://twitter.com/forlifeitself), and subscribing to our [mailing list](https://lifeitself.org/contact/). And as always, please feel free to [get in touch](https://lifeitself.org/contact/) with any questions, comments and/or feedback; we love hearing from you!

Best wishes,

Eilidh, Communications Associate 💛

## Want to get involved? Sign up to volunteer!

As we work on new projects, designs and ideas, it's really useful for us to gain fresh perspectives on what we're working on. For that reason, we're looking to develop a list of people who would be interested in volunteering to help us look over new designs and ideas. Volunteering will most likely consist of participating in short user research interviews, so nothing too complicated or time consuming. If that sounds intriguing, drop us an email at [hello@lifeitself.org](mailto:hello@lifeitself.org) and we'll pop your name down to inform you of upcoming volunteering opportunities.

## Upcoming Residencies & Retreats

### August 2022: Light, Shadow, Integration

How do we acknowledge our culture’s overrating of thought and theory, and the associated trauma, without getting caught in anti-thought and delusion (which are thoughts)? How do we discuss all the stuff that fills our heads without re-traumatising ourselves?

**What:** This residency will concentrate on enjoying presence and embodiment while playfully and lovingly dwelling with “spiritual” shadows – new dogmas or prides of a budding culture. Participants will be invited to bring their own practices, experiments and works, embodied or intellectual, into the open space, suggesting activities and co-creating our exploration. All activities will be optional and we will have time for our own work.

**When:** August 1st – 29th, 2022

**Where:** [Life Itself Praxis Hub, Bergerac](https://lifeitself.org/hubs/bergerac/), France (near Bordeaux)

**With:** [Liam Kavanagh](https://lifeitself.org/people/)

### Sep-Dec 2022: Embodying Collective Transformation

Sharing personal and collective practices to address the challenges of our time and help create a world that works for all life.

**What:** A series of three one-month-long residencies consisting of a seven-day intensive training in personal and group practices for courageous collective transformation, followed by a three-week community immersion to integrate and deepen these practices in our daily lives. The immersion includes time and space for you to continue your daily personal work and projects. Apply to attend just the week-long training, the entire month-long residency, or multiple months of residency.

**When:** September 2nd-30th; October 1st-30th; November 1st-30th

**Where:** [Life Itself Praxis Hub, Bergerac](https://lifeitself.org/hubs/bergerac/), France (near Bordeaux)

**With:** [Karl Steyaert](http://www.karlsteyaert.com/), [Nadine Helm](https://www.embracing-life.com/), & [Jocelyn Ames](https://becomingtogether.net/)

## Reflections on the Life Itself Open Residency

Marc Santolini, co-host of the Open Residency, has shared some reflections of his time at the Bergerac Hub during the past month:

“This Open Residency marked my third time at the Hub, this time as a co-host. The small-group format during the two weeks that I spent there allowed for a familial and relaxed atmosphere that was ideal for the early summer days. Our stay was punctuated by the few “Minimum Viable Practices” of collective living that are the heart of the hub: a morning meditation practice, a collective care of cooking and house maintenance, a shared meal and facilitated sharing circles.

With the summer days, we experimented with morning walking meditations and evening circles at the river, cooling off afterwards in the fresh water of the Dordogne. Our little crowd was a mix of artists and scientists, laying the ground for discussions spanning the rational and the embodied, from collective intelligence and organisational theories to shamanic rituals and ecospirituality, ultimately ending the day with some particularly inspired jam sessions to put these insights into practice. I am already looking forward to be back soon for more reflections on science, insight, and the further development and understanding of metamodern practices for collective living!”
