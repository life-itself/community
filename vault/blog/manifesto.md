_A community for people seeking a wiser world_

Though living in societies which have never been so rich our sense of purpose and connection is often missing. A growing number of us are seeking lives that are meaningful as well as productive yet we struggle to find a balance, finding ourselves trapped in conflict.

With Life Itself (Art/Earth/Tech) we want to offer a way to combine wiser and weller ways of living whilst remaining engaged in conventional society.

Our approach focuses on fostering a community of people seeking a wiser world. We do this by providing space, a network and knowledge. Space in the form of physical places that can act as homes for our community members to work, meet and stay. A network in the form of gatherings that bring the community together to reflect, learn and connect. Knowledge in the form of education and research to develop and share ideas, approaches and best practices.

We are practical and natural. We connect the ancient and the modern. Our interests ranges from nature to neuroscience, Dada to data. We seek harmony and balance: art and techne, earth and spirit, science and wisdom, freedom and discipline, mindfulness and intention. Our name reflects this commitment to a holistic approach.

**Art**: because it develops self-expression and our fundamental need to understand ourselves and to explore what it means to be human.

**Earth**: because to care about earth is to see oneself as part of something both greater and something whole. To find respect for earth is to find respect for ourselves.

**Tech**: because our techniques and technologies delimit and create our present and future. Tech is both a question of developing our craft but also of shaping what we create.
