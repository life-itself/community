# User Onboarding for Growth

The following is taken from _Julian.com's_ [Growth Marketing Guide](https://www.julian.com/guide/growth/user-onboarding).

## What is User Onboarding 

User onboarding is how you teach people how to use your product. Done well, your customer will be excited to get started.

It marks the user's experience between:
* Signing up and
* Becoming an engaged user

It consists of two phases: 

> **Their first use** — Everything the user experiences immediately upon signing up or buying for the first time. If you lose them here, odds are you'll lose them forever.  
>
> **Plus, follow-on engagement** — This includes the (1) messaging (emails, push notifications) that keep them engaged, plus (2) your sales and support outreach.

:::warning
Most SaaS apps lose 95% of their customers in the first 90 days.
:::

Despite this, onboarding is usually poorly done, because there generally isn't somebody responsible for _onboarding_ on its own. 

> Onboarding is a feature unto itself. It warrants resources dedicated to its thoughtful design, development, and optimization.

## Onboarding strategy

You need to follow the template in order to onboard successfully. 

> * First, identify your product's value to the user.
> * Then, map out the user's journey toward that value.
> * Identify the obstacles that exist along the way. 
> * Address them.

You address obstacles by making them:

> * Educational
> * Enticing
> * Low friction
> * Optionally, productive

## Obstacle identification

Obstacles are the steps in a user's journey that: 
* require the most work
* are the most boring to complete

To identify obstacles, you can record a user's browser history using a tool like [Full Story](https://www.fullstory.com/). You can then watch their activity to identify obstacles. 


> Here's an example of a bad interaction pattern: A user often creates then immediately deletes new projects. Hmm. 
>
> What are they really trying to accomplish? Was there an intermediate feature they wanted to momentarily access? If so, how about extract that feature to stand alone so they don't waste their time with fake project creation?
>
> You've found a hidden obstacle — unnecessary friction that analyzing analytics data alone would have been unlikely to reveal.
>
> More broadly, user recordings reveal where people spend more time than they should. And what causes them to get stuck and give up.

### Track purchase events

You can configure Full Story to track purchase events so you can compare the average onboarding journey of someone who purchased versus someone who did not. 

> Then, optimize your onboarding flow to usher more people toward mimicking the behaviors of those who purchase.
>
> ### Example: Twitter
> Twitter studied their users' onboarding behavior and discovered that if a new user doesn’t Follow at least a handful of Twitter users immediately upon signing up, they’re much less likely to return in the near future.
>
> Twitter therefore redesigned their onboarding to force users to follow a minimum of five people. And they ensure this process is low friction: They show you celebrities you're likely familiar with from topics (e.g. sports, movies) you indicated you liked.

### Recordings are better than analytics

Recordings give you the full context to a user's experience. Analytics don't. Analytics also require configuration in advance of a tracking event, which may lead to false conclusions. 

> So, begin onboarding obstacle identification by watching a significant sample of recordings. Then, refer to analytics to support hunches you acquire from recordings.

## Onboarding should be educational

Onboarding should answer: How do I get value out of this product?

To achieve this, you could include: 

> **Integrated walkthrough** — Walk the user through one feature at a time while having them fill out their profile or create a sample project in the process. This way, they're not empty-handed after your (likely boring) walkthrough. For example, if you’re building a website design tool, have them choose a starting template to tweak as they walk through your product.
>
> **Sample data and tooltips** — Or, if using your product is straightforward, you can place users directly into the dashboard. If relevant, provide pre-filled values and content to play with wherever they are expected to enter their own. This way, you don't force them do meaningless work to see how your product functions. Pair this sample data with callouts pointing out product features and their value. Be sparse with callouts. One or two is enough. More than that gets ignored.
>
> **Video** — Only if (a) your product's value can be enticingly visualized or (b) you have a complex product requiring detailed explanation, then coerce the user into watching a video demonstrating how to use your product. Keep the video short, get to the point immediately, skip the sales fluff (they've already decided to try you), and use captions so that audio isn't required.
>
> **Full course** — If your product is really, really complex, you can consider developing a video course like Webflow's. You should be worried if this is required.

Again, these should answer: how do I get value out of this product?

## Onboarding should be enticing as well

Onboarding should be educational _and_ enticing. Use value props to indicate how good life will be once they're done. 

> To do this, start by identifying the magical moments in your product — where the user gets maximum value. Maybe it's receiving a payment, finding a date, or killing an enemy tank. Then, visualize these outcomes during the onboarding experience.
>
> For example, look at how the scammy "dating" site, Ashley Madison, does it. They visualize your end goal (“finding women”) through blurred background photos while asking you to painstakingly enter your profile details. 

Show people the value they'll get once they've onboarded. 

> Want someone to read your boring tooltips during a walkthrough? How about wait until they engage with a feature before you explain it. That's when they'll care.
>
> Want someone to download your Chrome extension? Wait until they've become hooked by your web app. Then prompt them to adopt your whole ecosystem.
>
> Want someone to read your lengthy ebook? Wait until they've read one of your short, fantastic blog posts.
>
> Want someone to signup for your newsletter? Don't ask them immediately upon visiting your site. First, let them learn you're worth subscribing to.

### Write your pitch if you've got nothing to visualise

> For example, if you’re a service that helps people quit smoking, tell them how many other people successfully quit smoking using the service: 
>
> “About 15% of those who finish registering then complete the course. Don’t be one of the quitters, because if you complete this program, you have a whopping 85% chance of quitting smoking for life. This is your opportunity.”

## Onboarding should be low friction

The next step in the user's experience should always be clear, obvious, and low friction (quick and easy to perform).

> Start by listing every action users take toward purchasing. For a website design tool, users might follow this path:
>
> Enter their email and password.
> Create a sample site.
> Fool around with the design tool.
> Invite team members.
> Fully build a site.
> Enter their credit card. 
> Publish the site.
>
> Next, reduce friction at each step by applying these principles:
>
> **Reduce choice anxiety** — Hand-hold users through anxious moments. Any form field that requires users to put a lot of thought into their input (e.g. a dating profile bio) should be accompanied with suggestions on how to fill it out, e.g. “Describe your unique interests and explain why you're passionate about them.” And explain the outcome of filling each non-self-evident input. For example, if you have a share button for inviting coworkers, say, "If you invite coworkers, you can instantly share your work without having to manage back-and-forth emails." Ahh, so that's why I shouldn't ignore this button!
>
> **Reduce total workload** — Only ask for what you need. For example, consider pre-filling form inputs with your best guesses as to what the user would enter, then prompt them to correct each guess. Another tactic: Defer asking for input until you require it. Do you really need their full name to create their account, or can you request that after they’re engaged? (Once a user is engaged, you can get away asking them for a lot more.)
>
> **Reduce perceived complexity** — You can reduce the perceived complexity of onboarding tasks by visualizing what needs to be done using GIFs: Break the task into steps and visually demonstrate each. This approach covers how everyone likes to learn: visual, incremental, and structured. 

## Onboarding should be productive

> For example, if you’re an email app, have your walkthrough guide the user through cleaning up their inbox. This way, users accomplish something they care about while learning to use your app. It leaves them with a small dopamine hit. It delights them.
>
> Another example: If you’re a project management app, have your walkthrough leave users with the scaffolding required to share their project with team members.
>
> Nothing is more validating than receiving a product's value within minutes.

See [useronboard.com](https://www.useronboard.com/user-onboarding-teardowns/) for examples. [Duolingo's](https://www.useronboard.com/how-duolingo-onboards-new-users/?slide=40) is a good example.

## Onboarding Sumary

Remember these take-aways:

> Your onboarding should answer: "How do I get value out of the product?"
>
> Assume users are skeptical, lazy, and impatient.
>
> Onboarding is an amazing, high-leverage opportunity for you: If you nail the experience, you can instantly turn a user into a loyal customer.

## Virality

The triggers for virality surface during the onboarding.

> From the **referrer's** perspective, you're often prompted to invite your friends and colleagues after signing up for an app. 
> From the **referee's** perspective, onboarding is one of the first things you experience after clicking an invite link.

As a referee, onboarding is doubly critical: you haven't come to the site necessarily because of prior interest, but because your friend prompted you. 

> Consider how a referred user should not be directed to a signup page that immediately instructs them to claim their referral reward. First, pitch them on why they should even care to use the product and claim the reward. 

## Types of Virality

> **Inherent virality** occurs as a function of the product’s use. For example, to pay someone with PayPal, the payment recipient needs to first join PayPal. And who's not going to signup to get paid? No wonder PayPal's user base exploded.
>
> **Word-of-mouth** happens when users are overjoyed then proactively recommend your product.
>
> **Artificial virality** is a contrived reward system (e.g. cash, access) for referring others.

### Inherent virality 

Inherent virality is the best for explosive growth.

> Users use your app to transact or collaborate with others.
> 
> Users use your app to create content that is intended to be shared.

If your product doesn't fall into either of these categories, inherent virality won't happen. 

### Word of mouth

Second best. 

> Word-of-mouth's potential for your business is a function of how large your market is. If you only service 10 customers per month, you are unlikely to see runaway word-of-mouth. The law of large numbers isn't on your side, so you'll need to introduce artificial virality: coerce your few customers into referring at a very high rate.

### Artificial virality 

> Artificial virality boils down to knowing when to prompt for it and knowing how to best reward users.
> The best moment to ask for a referal: the moment somebody has just received value from your product. Make it fricitonless to invite others in these moments. 

> (A common incentive is the dual-ended reward, in which both the referrer and the referee are rewarded. Usually this takes the form of account credits or a discount.)

Most users are jaded by overmarketed offers, and therefore paltry cash incentives aren't very effective. 

> So, instead of offering cash, I recommend doling out rewards in the form of your product's primary value proposition. Meaning, provide greater access to the product.
>
> For example, when referring someone to Dropbox, you're rewarded with more gigabytes of storage. Storage is a more tangible, more immediate, and more relevant value proposition to you than getting $25 in credits to redeem at a later date.
>
> If you can't do this, cash rewards need to be _significant_. 

> For example, if you're a subscription service, offer the service for free for many months. Not just one month.
>
> If you're ecommerce, offer the product for free when someone refers X people

### Optimising virality

Focus on three metrics: 

> * The lag time between when a user signs up and refers someone.
> * The number of referrals made per user.
> * The signup percentage of those who received an invite.
>
> If you multiply the last two numbers together, you get your Viral Coefficient. A viral coefficient above 1 is an indicator of viral potential. If you couple this with a short lag time, you experience explosive growth.
>
> And if users are paying you instead of just signing up for free, congrats.
