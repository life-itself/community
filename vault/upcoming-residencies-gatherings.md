There will be plenty of Open Spaces for residents to learn, practice and share skills with one another. The residency includes time and space for you to continue your daily personal work and projects (35-40h/week).

## "Setting the World to Rights Residency", April-May 2023

- **When:** April 5th - May 2nd 2023
- **What:** A one month residency to focus on having exceptional big picture discussions. (The kind of discussions that draw the comment “You’re setting the world to rights!” Questions like: How do we address polarisation? How can we address global warming? How do we address the massive economic equality, racism and historical injustices that are rife across the globe? We won’t answer these questions, but we will do our utmost to have discussions that are really about *getting somewhere together* rather than scoring points. We will joyfully take up the neglected responsibility of citizens in a democracy, rather than a parlour game or indulgence
- **How much:** Dependent on rooming (around €1100 for accommodation, food, facilitation and practices)
- **Facilitator:** [Liam Kavanagh](https://www.liamkavanagh.me/), Victoria Wilding
