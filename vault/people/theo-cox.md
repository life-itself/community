Theo read Politics, Philosophy and Economics at the University of Oxford, and holds an MSc in Development Studies from the London School of Economics. His single greatest drive is to do the most good he can in the world, resulting in his spending probably a bit too much time ruminating on what it means to live a good life. When he’s not philosophising Theo is an avid martial artist, having competed in both western boxing and muay Thai and also regularly training in Brazilian jiujitsu. Despite his love of fighting he remains a committed pacifist in his day to day life, and is just as confused by this seeming contradiction as everyone else.
