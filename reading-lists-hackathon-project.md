# Reading lists hackathon project

## Goal

The aim of this project is to allow people to create and curate *reading lists* and *learning resources* around a particular topic and share them on the Life Itself website.

## Why?

- There are many resources out there for learning about a topic, but it can be hard to know where to start.
- We want to make it easier for people to find resources and get started on their learning journey.
- We want to make it easier for people to share their knowledge and expertise with others.
- There's a diversity of perspectives on any particular topic, so allowing users to create their own reading lists will help to cater for this.
- We want to provide a way for users to find out about topics that they might not have heard of before.

## Inspiration

- [Places Journal reading lists](https://placesjournal.org/reading-lists/) – great example of how this could look on the website
- [LessWrong library](https://www.lesswrong.com/library) – beautiful resource curation design (though it's only for LessWrong's own content)

## How?

### MVP (for the hackathon)

- Create a basic markdown template that users can duplicate in order to add their reading list to the website through a GitHub pull request.
  - User (creator) 
  - Topic
  - Description (of the list and/or topic)
  - List of resources. For each:
    - Type (e.g. book, paper, video, podcast, etc)
    - Title
    - Author
    - Link
    - Description (incl. why it was included in the list)
- Create a (manually curated) page on the Life Itself website that serves as an index of all the reading lists.
- Create 5-10 reading lists to start with.
- Create a page with some basic notes on how to add a reading list to the website.

### Future ideas

- Tie this in with a higher level knowledge map
- Auto-generate the reading list index page
- Allow users to submit reading lists without using GitHub
