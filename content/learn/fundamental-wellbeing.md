## Introduction

Dr. Jeffery Martin is a researcher on Fundamental Wellbeing and is focused on understanding and cultivating higher states of consciousness and well-being. He has conducted extensive studies exploring altered states of consciousness associated with terms like enlightenment, awakening, nonduality and non-symbolic consciousness.

Dr. Martin's research has identified common patterns and traits associated with these states resulting in a detailed [map of fudnamental wellbeing](#map).

By studying individuals who have experienced Fundamental Wellbeing, Dr. Martin seeks to uncover the underlying neurological, psychological, and physiological mechanisms that contribute to these states. As a result, he and collaborators have developed specific training programs and techniques that help people reach and sustain in these states.

His work provides valuable insights into human consciousness and offers practical approaches for people to enhance their overall well-being and spiritual experiences. Martin's approach is also noteworthy for bringing a rigor, empirics and science to a domain where such an approach is usually considered difficult or impossible to apply.

## What is Fundamental Wellbeing?

Fundamental Wellbeing is a term coined by Dr. Jeffery Martin as an overarching and secular term to encompass the many terms for such experiences (e.g. awakening, enlightenment, satori, samadhi, nirvana to name a few). This is the layman's term for what is known in academia as Persistent Non-Symbolic Experience.  

Fundamental Wellbeing is therefore the experience people have when they transition to this heightened human experience.

## What are the criteria for experiencing Fundamental Wellbeing?

Through Dr.Martins extensive interviews he was able to identify some key criteria that came with the transition to Fundamental Wellbeing that was reported across multiple faiths and religions:

- A reduction in thoughts, particularly self-reflective thoughts.
- Negative emotions would go away much faster (or negative motions do not exist at all)
- Living in the past and future is less common, mostly living in the present
- Feelings of persistent contentment
- An increased sense of connectedness

## What is Dr. Martin's research? 

In 2006, Dr. Martin started his PhD in Transformative Studies at the California Institute of Integral Studies determined to figure out how to become the happiest person on the planet. His approach began by surveying happy people. Not just any happy person off the street, but spiritually developed individuals from different religions and traditions which appeared to have attained full spiritual awakening. The surveys were to determine if there were psychological differences between these people and other people, however these initial findings did not indicate anything specifically unique.  

Following this his team conducted live interviews with the selection of people using cognitive science techniques which enabled them to capture consistent data between different individuals across different religions, traditions and experiences that could be compared. This lead to the range of criteria of Fundamental Wellbeing, which has been continually researched by Dr. Martin. You can learn more about this in episode one of our interviews.

## How do you reach Fundamental Wellbeing?

Those who have transitioned to Fundamental Wellbeing have done so through many gateways and environments, from deep spiritual devotion to psychedelic experiences. However, through his research Dr. Martin has developed a protocol for people to follow to transition to Fundamental Wellbeing.

While no single persons journey is the same, there are 24 tried and tested methods which enable people to access Fundamental Wellbeing. In the [Finders course](https://45daystoawakening.com/sales-page-412549911595138654190), Dr. Martin shares these methods with astounding results. Over the course of 6 weeks, 65% of attendees experience Fundamental Wellbeing.

## The Martin Matrix: a detailed map of fundamental wellbeing

![[persistent-non-symbolic-experience-fundamental-wellbeing-dr-jeffery-martin-location-map.jpeg]]
_The location continuum of Fundamental Wellbeing (Persistent Non-Symbolic Experience) is one axis of the Martin Matrix_

Based on Dr. Martin's research, he was able to create a matrix/map of Fundamental Wellbeing and describe the different dimensions of experience. The axis are the location and the layer, where location describes the level of Fundamental Wellbeing and the layer describes the depth of the experience. 

The deepest layer and highest location is the peak stat of Fundamental Wellbeing. Learn more about the Martin Matrix and the descriptions of the layers and locations in part 2 and 3 of the interview and in this video below.

## Appendix 

The most recent version of Martin's map is from his keynote at the Society for Consciousness Studies 2021 Conference: [The Martin Matrix, a Comprehensive Map of Persistent Non-Symbolic Experience (Enlightenment/Nondual)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aCfeamM07dk) (YouTube Dec 22 2021).

> The Martin Matrix, a Comprehensive Map of Persistent Non-Symbolic Experience In the spirit of previous milestones such as the "Wilber-Combs Matrix", this talk presents a new comprehensive model covering different types and depths of Persistent Non-Symbolic Experience (PNSE; i.e.: enlightenment, nonduality, the peace that passeth understanding, unity consciousness, etc.). Publications and presentations over the previous 15 years of research have extensively detailed the “types” axis of the matrix. This was often confusing to the interested public, because most previous models by religious, spiritual, and philosophical traditions and teachers primarily refer to experiences in the “depth” axis of the matrix. This is the first academic presentation covering the “depth” axis, and will also explore how various depths of PNSE change across its types, which degree of depth is most resonant with a given type, and so on.
