> Through understanding what has and what continues to shape our culture we can actively choose to create a wiser one.

At Life Itself, we understand the complexities and intricacies that shape our worlds, from our individual choices, to our wider societal models. By diving deeper into Culturology, we can gain a greater understanding of humanities development, plight, and potential. This ultimately paves the way for us to take aligned action that works to cultivate healthier societies and the paradigm shift so desperately needed. 

**By the end of this page you will know:**
- What Culturology is
- The factors that have and continue to influence our cultures and success
- How WEIRD and non-WEIRD cultures differ and what we can learn from both
- Where we can go to next

## What is Culturology?

Culturology is an interdisciplinary field that focuses on the study of culture and its various interrelated aspects. It encompasses the examination of how culture shapes and influences human behavior, beliefs, values, norms, practices, and expressions. Through the analysis of different forms of cultural production, such as literature, art, music, language, rituals, and the interdisciplinary areas such as history, politics, economics, technology, psychology, anthropology and sociology, culturology research supports the understanding of the development, and potential trajectory and impact of culture globally, locally and individually.

It plays an important role in uncovering the underlying meanings and influences that shape human experiences and societies, the development and evolution of culture, societies, human behavior and innovation and provides a deeper appreciation and comprehension of the diverse cultures that exist in the world. 
## Cultural Evolution: A New Discipline is Born Series

The best way to learn is through our Podcast Series. Through 4 episodes Rufus and Joseph take us on a journey to better understand what makes humans successful, how culture both develops and impacts us on individual and societal levels, the fundamental differences between those who are WEIRD and those who aren't, and how family, religion and psychological factors have all played a significant role in developing and influencing cultural development. 

They dive into a wide range of subjects, including the concept of "cultural dark matter," the influence of religion and rituals on society, the role of trust and cooperation, the potential for tracking cultural innovation, the challenges of balancing individualism and collectivism, the potential for cross-fertilization among different intentional communities and more!

We are left contemplating where do we go from here, as we discover the potential for this research area to gain even deeper traction in supporting the development of a wiser, weller world.
