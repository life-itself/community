Marc Santolini is a network scientist who studies how individuals and groups innovate, collaborate and learn, with a particular focus on open and citizen science communities and the open-source movement. He holds a PhD in Statistical Physics from Ecole Normale Supérieure Paris, where he studied Complex Systems Physics and Philosophy of Science. Fascinated by the emergence of higher-order simplicity out of complex interactions, he specialized in network science applied to biological, medical and social contexts at the Barabasi Lab in Boston, before becoming a research fellow at the Learning Planet Institute (formerly Center for Research and Interdisciplinarity, CRI) of Université Paris Cité. He is also a co-founder of the Just One Giant Lab NGO that supports the development of emergent, large-scale open research communities through social and digital technologies. His current research ties network approaches and participatory methods to foster collaborative dynamics and relational well-being in open innovation contexts.
