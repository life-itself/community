_A community for people, who recognise the meta-crises we face, know there is a possibility of a new paradigm and are ready to do something about it!_

## What is the Life Itself Community?

Welcome to our digital village! Just like a traditional village, we are a diverse community encompassing multiple generations, various backgrounds, professions, and skills. However, it's our unity in this diversity that truly shines as we come together to exchange, collaborate, learn, and innovate collectively. Our purpose is to transcend individualism and foster an inclusive environment rooted in a culture of mutual support and care.

The community is a rich mycelial ecosystem of movers and shakers doing their bit to create a wiser, weller world. From researchers to storytellers, farmers to financiers we transcend traditional mechanistic identities and embody the ideals of renaissance people.

We are not this or that, we are both/and.

Join 200+ other members in seeding the second renaissance! ðŸŽ‰
## How can I get involved?

The easiest low-effort, high yield way to get involved in the community is to join our Whatsapp chat and our bi-monthly online gatherings. From there, the amount of investment in the community is up to you - but the more you put in the more you get out!
