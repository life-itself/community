_A community for people, who recognise the meta-crises we face, know there is a possibility of a new paradigm and are ready to do something about it!_

## What is the Life Itself Community?

Welcome to our digital village! Just like a traditional village, we are a diverse community encompassing multiple generations, various backgrounds, professions, and skills. 

Join 300+ other members in seeding the second renaissance! ðŸŽ‰

The Life Itself Community and its associated fora are spaces for:

1.  ðŸ‘¥ Connection - Through the community chat we hope to connect deeply together and develop new relationships. Most importantly we encourage openness for a diversity of perspectives and connecting with people who think and do differently and yet aspire to the same need for change.Â 
2.  ðŸ’¯ Collaboration - Within connection, opens a creative space for collaboration between community members. This could be in the form of participating in an event, joining an organization, or simply creating ideas together.Â 
3.  ðŸ“šEducation - This is a space for information sharing, skill sharing and knowledge development. We will carry out group discussions led by researchers, academicians, and industry experts. These discussions can be led by the community members as well; reach out to the admins to suggest your topic and schedule your group discussion.
4.  ðŸ’« Support - To foster mutual support between community members, whatever that might be. This is a space of encouragement, hope, and possibility.
