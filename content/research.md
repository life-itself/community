We are a collective researching paths to an awakening society[^1]. We produce reports, papers, methods and tools.

[^1]: An awakening society is a society oriented to awakening: personal and collective development towards greater peace, freedom, insight and wisdom. Put crudely, it prioritises **inner** growth as opposed to **outer** growth. See [[awakening-society|awakening society page]] for more.

## About the Community

For us, research has a broad meaning. It includes both general, systematic inquiry and sensemaking as well as more formal academic-style work.

### What topics?

We are open to all topics that have a clear connection with a wiser, weller world society. However, we currently have three focus areas. These are, in order of priority:

- **Ontology and culturology**, i.e. the study ("science") of personal and collective development -- inner development and cultural evolution. For example, a rich literature documents the dramatic shifts in childrens' cognition, emotions and worldview as they mature, but what about the rest of our lives: are we stuck where we are or can we continue to develop and in what ways?
- **The politics of paradigmatic change**: collective action and movement building for a foundational shift in our onto-socio-economic systems. For example, how have large scale paradigmatic changes occurred in the past, for example the transition from pre-modern medieval societies to modern ones?
- **Systems transformation**: that is, paradigmatic shifts in socio-economic (eco)systems For example, a move from a proprietary digital economy to an open one, from a carbon-based energy system to a post-carbon one, or, more generally, from capitalism to post-capitalism.

### What principles?

The following principles & practices inform our approach:

- Rigor: critical inquiry and empirical evaluation.
- Open-mindedness: we value wisdom and contemplative self-enquiry approaches as much as knowledge produced from traditional scientific methods.
- Generous listening and steel-manning: we look for the best version of any view or approach. Participation is a chance to exchange with peers engaged in rich and varied ecologies of practices.
- Integrity: we operate with honesty and treat our and each other's commitments with respect.

## How to Participate

We conduct our work primarily online and in the open and anyone can observe and contribute to discussions in the [forum][] and elsewhere. We also have bases in our [[hubs/bergerac|Bergerac Hub]] and there are in person gatherings from time to time.

[forum]: https://github.com/orgs/life-itself/discussions/categories/research

### Monthly Open Meeting

We organize a monthly open meeting that anyone can join:

- When: 3pm European time on the second Friday of the month.
- Where: online on google hangouts https://meet.google.com/rks-pfqv-dbz

The meeting is a chance to:

- Learn about the community and connect with others
- Get updates on ongoing work and hear brown bag talks
- Coordinate across interest groups and activities

### Participation Levels

So people have a sense of the dynamics of the community we define two levels of participation.

#### Guests

- Can observe and contribute to discussions on the forum (we work in the open) 
- Can attend the monthly open forum
- Can apply to become full members
- Agree to the general [[tao/community-guidelines|Community Guidelines]]

#### Members

- Access to research whatsapp group
- Listed on site
- Access to resources such as the library
- Opportunity to share your work e.g. brown bag talks
- Can start interest groups and projects

To become a member you usually need to:

- Have participated actively in the community
- Be nominated by one or more existing members
- Have proven ability to engage in systematic inquiry and present the results. This could be (but need not be) academic style research.

Membership is usually for one year, indefinitely renewable.

## Topics

### Ontology and culturology aka the study of inner development and cultural evolution

Our primary topic focus is ontology and culturology i.e. the study ("science") of personal and collective inner development.

Specifically their nature and causes:

- What is our nature and potential?
- How does development happen?
- What is culture and cultural evolution?
- What are the causes and the factors such practices/environments that influence these?

Regarding the latter item, we have a particular interest in **conscious collectives and deliberately development spaces**.

We are also particularly interested in **contemplative science**, that is rigorous empirical inquiry into contemplative practices and experiences.

Finally, we are also very interested in the consequences of being and culture in relation to wellbeing and wisdom/performance at the personal and collective level (e.g. teams, coliving communities, societies etc). For example, how do culture influence the innovativeness or happiness of societies?

### Systems transformation

A secondary and complementary theme is paradigmatic shifts in socio-economic (eco)systems. For example, a shift from a proprietary digital economy to an open one, or a carbon-based energy system to a post-carbon one.

### Politics of paradigmatic social change

A tertiary theme is the politics of paradigmatic change as in collective action and movement building for a foundational shift in our onto-socio-economic systems.

This integrates the previous two areas in that paradigmatic shift incorporates a substantive evolution in both our cultural and socio-economic systems. This theme is also a concretizing one where the ideas in the previous two areas turn into concrete policy and practices for transformative change.
 
Within this broad area a specific and active sub-area is **ecosystem mapping and field-building** i.e. delineating a field/ecosystem, identifying actors, weaving them together etc.

## FAQs

### What topics do you work on?

See above

### Is there funding?

Groups within the Research Community can potentially apply for funding or consultancy work via the Life Itself organization. For example, we have previously been granted funding for a collaborative European H2020 project and a variety of other projects.
