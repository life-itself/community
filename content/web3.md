## Making Sense of Crypto & Web3

**UPDATE: \[March 2022\]** We have launched a dedicated site for this project: [https://web3.lifeitself.org/](https://web3.lifeitself.org/). Read more in the [announce post](https://lifeitself.org/2022/03/16/making-sense-of-crypto-and-web3-launch/).

## Original Overview

Interest in Web3, initially defined as a ["decentralized online ecosystem based on blockchain"](https://www.wired.com/story/web3-gavin-wood-interview/) and encompassing technologies such as cryptocurrencies, non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and decentralised autonomous organisations (DAOs), is growing massively.

Life Itself has noticed a huge degree of excitement, in parts of our own [highly skeptical](/assets/BTC-QF.pdf).

The large amounts of information, noise and often fierce divergences of opinion circulating within the Web3 conversation mean it is hard to establish a firm fact of the matter around what potential might exist, in what areas, and what concretely needs to be done in order to help it be realised.

This initiative sees Life Itself bring our own expertise, particularly in the realm of social and cognitive sciences, to bear on both the systemic dimensions of Web3 interventions (governance, public goods funding and so on) and the underlying sensemaking of the field as a whole.

## Research agenda

We have begun our work by planning a research agenda for our inquiry, shown in the diagram below:
