## What is Conscious Coliving? 

There’s not really an established term yet for the kind of way of living that we imagine and seek to pioneer. We've come to call it "conscious coliving" reflecting the fusion of two related practices: conscious living and coliving.

It is the practice of living in community, in any format, and dedicating oneself to conscious living and embodiment. The spectrum of conscious coliving environments is broad and can be anything from three friends living in a house together, to an entire village.

## Why is Conscious Coliving Important?

At the core of Life Itself's Theory of Change, is that for us to step into the new paradigm we must create seeds for the [[second-renaissance|Second Renaissance]]. These seeds are cultivated from physical spaces where people can connect deeply and innovate social, spiritual and practical elements for the next paradigm.

Conscious coliving is therefore fundamental to seeding the Second Renaissance. By living together we are actively and consciously working on our personal, interpersonal and collective development. 

To gain more context on why conscious coliving is important read our article about deliberately developmental space (AKA Conscious Coliving Spaces): [[deliberately-developmental-spaces-a-key-to-addressing-the-metacrisis|Deliberately Developmental Spaces: A Key to Addressing the Metacrisis]]

## Our Approach to Conscious Coliving: Research, Education, Practice, Support

We take a multifaceted approach to developing the conscious coliving movement with the ultimate goal of making it a mainstream practice.

**Education:** Resource building around conscious coliving through courses, interviews, community calls and articles. Start with the [[conscious-coliving-course|Conscious Coliving 101 course]].

**Research:** Our work on Deliberately Developmental Spaces delves into the ideas, methodologies, tools and establishments that are fundamental to the paradigm shift. This includes coliving spaces, educational institutions and other organisations. Read the manifesto here: [https://developmentalspaces.org/](https://developmentalspaces.org/)

**Practice:** The Bergerac Praxis Hub, is a space for people to experience conscious coliving in action. While the residencies cover many topics at its core is the fact that attendees will live in community together for at least one month. This is a fantastic opportunity to try out conscious coliving (especially with people you might want to live with in the future). Learn more: [[bergerac|The Life Itself Praxis Hub Page]]

**Support:** The Life Itself community is a growing online community of people interested in conscious coliving and more generally creating a wiser, weller world. There are opportunities to connect with like-minded people, have your questions about conscious coliving answered and join regular community calls about conscious coliving.
