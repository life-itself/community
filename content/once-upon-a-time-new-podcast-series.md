The Once Upon a Time podcast series is a new series featuring the lives of ordinary people choosing an extra-ordinary path.

A collection of tales of ordinary people choosing an extra-ordinary life seedling a second renaissance. These pioneers saw something and acted upon their insights to bring forth a new world of an awakening society. This is how hope and faith spreads, with stories of transformation, embodied in ordinary people choosing an extra-ordinary path.Â 

In today's world, where disillusionment with the conventional consumerist dream is pervasive, many are searching for an alternative. This series is a testament to that alternative. Our conversations seek out individuals who have chosen to lead extra-ordinary lives, exploring the motivations behind their choices and the impact of their upbringing and environment. We dive into their practices, points of transformation, and the delicate balance between retreat from worldly temptation and engagement with social change.

At the heart of these extraordinary lives, lies a common thread: unwavering commitment to something greater than themselves. Through the power of storytelling, we aim to demystify the concept of hero worship, revealing that these figures are not larger-than-life beings, but rather individuals who found something worth dedicating their lives to. By sharing their remarkable stories, we aim to inspire listeners to believe in their own potential for making a difference and embarking on their own extra-ordinary paths.

The series opens with Jamie Bristow, a leading expert on inner development and contemplative practices in public life, who shares his journey from troubled teenager to mindfulness teacher. Over the coming weeks, we welcome Liam Kavanagh and Valerie Duvauchelle as they each share their own journey with Sylvie Barbier, plus many more. Each episode ranges from 45 minutes to an hour. We hope you find it inspirational.
