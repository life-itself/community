We exist during a period of great awakening, the Second Renaissance, a new dawn for a new civilization moving from modernity into what comes next. 

But what does come next? The Second Renaissance is the time between worlds, the bridge that is taking us through this transition period and birthing a new paradigm. A paradigm that needs to be radically weller and wiser. 

On this page, you can learn more about the Second Renaissance and the practical cultivation of this new paradigm through our courses, articles, blogs, books and interviews. Come back regularly as we add new content in early 2024.
