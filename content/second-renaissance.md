We live in a moment of civilizational crisis and awakening: the Second Renaissance. It is a time between worlds, as we witness the collapse of the old paradigm and the birth of the new -- moving from modernity into what comes next.

But what does come next? What will be born during this second renaissance? A future we believe that is radically weller and wiser. 

However, this is also a time of crisis. There is always a darkness before dawn. Think back to the last renaissance which was separated from the high middle ages by the black death, famine and war.

On this page, you can learn more about the Second Renaissance and the practical ways to contribute to its development through our courses, articles, blogs, books and interviews.

## Introduction to the Second Renaissance: Our Free Course

The course introduces the idea of a second renaissance: this moment of civilizational crisis and transition  as we move from modernity into what comes next. Amongst other things, it covers the idea of views and values as "foundations" of our societies, cultural paradigms and their role history, the birth and decay of modernity,  and what comes next!
