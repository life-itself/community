title: Plan 2018
---

We did not do a formal plan for 2018.

Major things we were doing at that time:

- We had launched the London Hub in Nov 2017 with a proper start in Jan 2018.
- We were developing the institute led by Laurie and Liam. Laurie [drew up a plan in May 2018](docs.google.com/document/d/1LQLraImUMOKdx7rr_TTlPjXLAaoZhwI0dbqzARrT0UE/edit#) (needs tidying!).
- In October we took over Datopian
- We launched the Open Revolution
