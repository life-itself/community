Below are the key views in which the work of Life Itself is grounded.

* [[../notes/primacy-of-being|Primacy of Being]] — at least assuming basic material needs are met, our "way of being" is the most important factor for both personal and collective wellbeing.
* [[../notes/zen|Zen]] — the art of seeing into the nature of one's own being, Zen points the way towards freedom.
* [[../blog/2017/09/10/four-types-of-problem|Four types of problem]] — we are suffering from a fetish of "techno-solutionism," mistakenly thinking that all problems can be solved with science and technology.
* [The Two Arms of Transformation](https://rufuspollock.com/2017/02/10/two-arms-of-transformation/) — both economic and spiritual transformation are necessary to bring about a better future.
* [[../blog/2017/06/13/sketches-of-a-future-society-part-one|Sketches of a Future Society]] — our vision for the future is one of spiritual wellbeing, collective wisdom and an open information economy which fosters collaboration, generosity and creativity.
* [[../blog/2017/06/28/the-middle-way-what-were-about|The Middle Way]] — this is the way Life Itself is seeking; a way which synthesises the best qualities of spirituality and pragmatism, engagement and reflection.
* [[../notes/true-joy-in-life|True Joy in Life]] — "This is the true joy in life, to be used for a purpose recognized by yourself as a mighty one..."
* [[../notes/not-everyone-knows-what-is-good-for-them|Not everyone knows what they want]] – knowing (or discovering) what we *really* want is hard and takes effort. 
* [[../notes/what-is-so|What is So]] – Ask yourself what's so and align with that. Align with what’s so and it will not matter. That is the foundation of transformation and satisfaction.
