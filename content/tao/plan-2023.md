# Plan 2023

# Conscious Coliving Comms Workstream

Objective: Become the leading community for conscious coliving

Why? We touch conscious coliving in both intellect (DDS) and practice (Praxis), giving us a fantastic opportunity to synergise the work of Life Itself across all elements (Research, Comms, Praxis) 

## Q3 2023

Objective: "Launch Conscious Coliving workstream with CC101"

## Q4 2023

Objective: Launch CC101 followup course and establish CC as a primary focus of Life Itself

Secondarily

- Establish conscious coliving as a primary focus of Life Itself in the consciousness of our community and more broadly

?? Background: It appears that conscious coliving is a topic that draws in Life Itself People, based on our work in this area so far. We need to continue with this experiment and this require focus.

### Key Results for Q4 

- Streamlined and consistent "offers"
  - All current offers assessed for relationship to conscious coliving
  - Conscious Coliving terminology used wherever appropriate
  - Landing page of Life Itself rejigged (if appropriate)
  - Page explaining: CC, DDS and residencies fit together
  - A single excellent entry point for CC at lifeitself.org
- Offering(s) with registrations for people wanting to go "deeper" into conscious coliving and investigate it
  - (tbc) CC101 email follow up has 100 signups
  - (tbc) CC101 follow up online course has 30 signups
- Next steps defined for 2024

## Why this approach

We want ...

- Deeper: people to go further after CC101
- More: more people to do CC101 and join the community

*Why?*

- Active CC group at Life Itself
- It relates to other offers such as the hub

*Why?*

- Build a sangha/field around conscious coliving
- Become an authority for conscious coliving

*Why - Strategic relationship*

- There's way more conscious coliving and DDS happening b/c that's crucial (we think) to second renaissance
  - Conscious coliving spaces are getting set up
  - People are joining them
- It's a part of our pizza: Life Itself type people are interested in coliving with a conscious and even DDS flavor

## Inbox: objectives for the future

- Start establishing CC as an idea (whose time has come) e.g. manifesto etc
  - Conscious Coliving defined in a public, visible way and attention drawn to it 
    - Manifesto launched
    - CC101 has 500 signups
    - Campaign to establish ourselves in the consciousness of our community more broadly (around this topic) ???
- An active "core" of the CC community e.g. some potential evangelists/ambassadors

# Appendix: Comms Strategy medium-term

1. Discover what are "Life Itself type people" 
2. Discover what "beacons" attract them (i.e. topics, events, offerings etc).

These two activities/objectives are synergistic with one leading into the other: i.e. we create a beacon for a given persona/job story and then see who that attracts and then refine our target audience etc.

Our rough initial definition of "Life Itself type person":

> People interested/committed to embodied practical action for a second renaissance with primacy of being flavor

## Objectives related to this (for next year)

A short "Intro to Life Itself and Second Renaissance" "beacon" that "ambassadors" can run with e.g. 6-8 people over 4-6 weeks and have it tested by at least 2-3 groups.

# Appendix: Life Itself Strategy Background

Our overall strategy for the coming years (next decade?) adheres to our theory of change:

- We want the next paradigm to begin
  - To do this we need a renaissance
    - We want to create pockets of "Ambassadors of the 2nd renaissance" and other actors
      - We want to create a frame for people to develop pockets
        - We want to gather people who are Life Itself Types people - generate Sangha of Second Renaissancers ðŸ‘ˆ WE ARE HERE 
          - We want to create beacons that attract people to Life Itself ðŸ‘ˆ WE ARE ALSO HERE

> Is the bigger focus finding and attracting pioneers or cultivating sangha ... **Focus right now is building the sangha** 
o/c long term we want both sangha and pioneers
