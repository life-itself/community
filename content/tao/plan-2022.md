## Possibility

Building on bridgeheads. solidifying, grounding, developing

## Circles, Streams and their OKRs

| Circle | Description (What) | Objective / Outcome | Outputs |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
| [Praxis] Hubs = Deliberately Developmental Programs | Experimental spaces and sangha to nurture sustained multidimensional personal and collective development [in consciousness and systems] | Position ourselves as people doing integral developmental praxis rigorously | - 1 deliberately developmental residency<br/>- conceptual grounding and literature/tradition review<br/>- survey of activity (another ecosystem mapping!) |
| Labs (Research and thought leadership) | Create a self-funding Lab that does paid work consonant with Life Itself’s core themes while acting as a sustainable source of revenue. | Cement ourselves as leading group in emerging metamodern ecosystem<br/><br/>Incubate Labs so as to establish our credibility in systems space and as a sustainable source of revenue | - Funded ecosystem mapping<br/>- Outgroup engagement e.g. speaking to other spaces<br/>- Consulting offer<br/>- BizDev plan<br/>- 1-5 further consulting project(s) |

> [!note]
> 
> Community and Pioneers is deprioritized for now given the resources we have. Where it is done, we focus on lightweight methods that synergize with other activities e.g. hangouts can be a lead in to the residencies etc.

## Initiatives planning esp for Q1

See Initiatives sheet in [2022 Budget and OKRs](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lua4wuE2ZwB0IlYZ7gK0KSj4GFDc5F_efNkh6Umm9n0/edit#gid=1311442204)

## Budget

Principle for the year: for our internal spending we should be investing rather than funding. Internal spending should focus on securing external income streams i.e. grants for spaces and ecosystem mapping (including MVP development and comms), and BizDev for Labs.
