> We sense an emerging ecosystem that is growing. More and more people are talking about what we are calling the "Second Renaissance" ecosystem, although people are using different names, e.g. Metamodern, Integral, Regenerative, Liminal Web, Metacrisis, Game B. More and more people are also trying to map and make sense of this ecosystem, e.g. Catalist, Limicon, Gaianet. There is growing recognition between people who are aware of or part of the ecosystem around practices, thinkers, virtual or physical gathering places, analysis of “what’s wrong” and “what’s needed” – but the ecosystem’s identity is still quite vague and swirling, and may indeed never converge into a single clear identity.

This page provides an overview of the names and terms that others in the space have been gravitating towards when discussing or referring to this emerging ecosystem. It is intended as a resource to learn more about each term, the intellectual lineage and perspective(s) it represents, and the communities within the ecosystem that tend to be associated with them. As we add more information and analysis over time, we hope that it will contribute towards a deeper understanding of the similarities and differences that exist within this diverse ecosystem. 

## Ecosystem names & terms

Over the last few years, a number of names and terms have been used to describe or refer to the emerging Second Renaissance ecosystem. As we’ve gathered these together, we’ve noticed that these terms seem to fall into three categories. One set of names refers to the paradigm that is being born (e.g. metamodern, regenerative, Game B, integral). Another set emphasises the transition itself (e.g. the great turning, second renaissance, liminal web); while the final set draws attention to the point of breakdown and crisis that we currently find ourselves in (e.g. metacrisis, polycrisis).

### The Second Renaissance

The “Second Renaissance” refers to a major civilisational transition that is currently underway: from the paradigm of modernity, which is breaking down, into what comes next. The Second Renaissance is a time between worlds – a period of civilisational crisis and awakening. 

In 2023, Life Itself began referring to the civilisational transition underway as the “Second Renaissance”. The term “Renaissance”, meaning “rebirth”, captures the profound changes at a civilisational level in our fundamental views about ourselves, our relationships with others and the world, what is important, etc. The term highlights the process of becoming, rather than predefining a destination.

### Metamodern

> “Metamodernism” is a term used to articulate developments in contemporary culture and society that, some argue, represent a move beyond postmodernism. Metamodernism can be characterised as a move from the irony and cynicism characteristic of postmodernism, towards a yearning for sincere and constructive expression and progression. It is the emergence of an ostensible collective desire for change.” [2](https://lifeitself.org/blog/2022/03/11/mapping-metamodern-what-is-metamodernism)

The term was originally coined in 1975 by Mas’ud Zavarzade to describe an emerging cultural trend in American literature. [3](https://nesslabs.com/metamodernism) The term has since been widely used beyond the realm of art and literature, and has become a popular term for referring to the ecosystem. Key thinkers operating under this term include Hanzi Freinacht, Timotheus Vermeulen, Robin van den Akker, Lene Rachel Andersen, and Jason Josephson Storm.

### Polycrisis

“Polycrisis” refers to “the simultaneous occurrence and interaction of multiple interconnected crises across various domains, creating a complex and intertwined web of challenges.” [4](https://www.realitystudies.co/p/explaining-polycrisis-and-metacrisis)

The term was coined in the 1999 book Homeland Earth: A Manifesto for a New Millennium by Edgar Morin and Anne Brigitte Kern, [5](https://www.realitystudies.co/p/explaining-polycrisis-and-metacrisis) and was recently popularised by historian [Adam Tooze](https://adamtooze.substack.com/p/chartbook-165-polycrisis-thinking). [6](https://perspecteeva.substack.com/p/prefixing-the-world)

### Metacrisis

In an essay titled “[Prefixing the World](https://perspecteeva.substack.com/p/prefixing-the-world)”, Jonathan Rowson defines the metacrisis as:

> ”the historically specific threat to truth, beauty, and goodness caused by our persistent misunderstanding, misvaluing, and misappropriating of reality. The metacrisis is the crisis within and between all the world’s major crises, a root cause that is at once singular and plural, a multi-faceted delusion arising from the spiritual and material exhaustion of modernity that permeates the world’s interrelated challenges and manifests institutionally and culturally to the detriment of life on earth.” [7](https://perspecteeva.substack.com/p/prefixing-the-world)

The term has gained significant traction within the ecosystem. Key thinkers include Jonathan Rowson and Daniel Schmachtenberger.

### The Liminal Web

In 2021, Joe Lightfoot published a blog post attempting to map “an emergent subculture of sensemakers, meta-theorists & systems poets”, which he termed the “Liminal Web”:

> ”a collection of thinkers, writers, theorists, podcasters, videographers and community builders who all share a high crossover in their collection of perspectives on the world. It not only includes creators of content but also the people and communities who resonate with the constellation of ideas such creators put forward.” [8](https://www.joelightfoot.org/post/the-liminal-web-mapping-an-emergent-subculture-of-sensemakers-meta-theorists-systems-poets)
### Integral

Integral theory is American philosopher Ken Wilber’s attempt to bring everything anyone has ever learnt from any culture into one framework. An integrated approach pursues a holistic view: an integration of mind, body, and spirit; an integration of material and spiritual values; and an integration of Eastern and Western philosophies and worldviews. [9](https://lifeitself.org/blog/2022/05/27/mapping-metamodern-integral)

### The Great Turning

The Great Turning, coined by Joanna Macy, is a shift from the Industrial Growth Society to a life-sustaining civilisation. [10](https://www.ecoliteracy.org/article/great-turning)

### The Regenerative Movement

Originally a movement for ecological sustainability, the term has expanded to include design of regenerative cultures for human and planetary health.

### Game B

Game B is a sense-making community espousing a need for a collective shift from “Game A” (old paradigm) to a new kind of civilisation (“Game B”) that does not reproduce the rivalrous dynamics inherent in Game A which produce existential risk. [11](https://www.gameb.wiki/index.php?title=Game_B)

Key thinkers include Jim Rutt and Jordan Hall.
