We are forming a group of "proto trustees" to shape the future of the Life Itself Bergerac Praxis Hub. They will support the further evolution of this space playing a major role in an emerging "second renaissance" metamodern/metacrisis ecosystem.

The [[../hubs/bergerac|Life Itself Bergerac Hub]] has been running for [[2021/09/13/announcing-the-sympoiesis-residencies-at-the-life-itself-praxis-hub|over two years in its current residency model]] and for more than three in total. It is already starting to play a significant role in the wider ecosystem of which it is part -- we've hosted over twenty residencies with hundreds of residents from multiple continents.

The Hub is an integral part of a wider vision for a growing [[../second-renaissance|"second renaissance"]] [movement][ecosystemp]. It is a space for people to gather and experiment with the embodied presence and practical action needed in the face of the metacrisis. (See more here: https://lifeitself.org/hubs/bergerac)

[ecosystem]: https://ecosystem.lifeitself.org/

However, the hub is still fledgling and needs help to bring it to a state of a "self-sustaining organism".

For this reason, we are forming a group of "proto trustees" to steward and shape the hub going forward. The purpose of this group is to provide advice and direction and to help the hub flourish. Proto-trustees would, if they wished, have the ability to organize events at the hub and would have direct input into shaping the hub going forward.

In terms of involvement, there is some flexibility. The minimum would be engaging for at least 6-12 months, attending an initial briefing and joining a whatsapp group (or similar) plus attendance at meetings (no more than monthly with attendance at every meeting not required).

Overall, the main thing we want from trustees is an active interest in helping the hub thrive.

Finally, we emphasize that the proto-trustees are not asked to be responsible for day to day operations or financial oversight etc.

## More details

- What is the hub? The Life Itself Bergerac Praxis hub is a fourteen bedroom space situated next to the Dordogne river in the beautiful medieval town of Bergerac in south-west France.
- What is the proto trustee group? An informal collective interested and invested in seeing the Hub evolve and thrive.
  - What is a trustee "traditionally"? Someone in a position of trust who is taking responsibility for stewarding something
  - Why proto? Because a) this is a first step in evolving the governance of the hub b) not a formal set of trustees
- Who will run the operations of the Hub? For now, Life Itself "core" will take financial and operational responsibility for the Hub.
