## More about the Gathering

This year we would like to revive our great founding event – the Gathering – because we want to share with you the vision of a second renaissance. The Gathering will happen in  two parts:

- Part I: 13th to 16th June (arrival on 12th): sharing the vision of the second renaissance through workshops and talks.

- Part II: 17th to the 23rd June: a co-working and connecting week for people to make art, projects and friends with a presentation on the 22nd of June at the final “celebration of life” party.

Important note: you can come a) just for Part I or b) both Part I and Part II.  

Where: The Gathering will take place at the Life Itself Farmhouse Hub in Thénac, next to the famous Plum Village zen monastery. Recently renovated, and surrounded by vineyards and woods the farmhouse complex is 20 minutes south of Bergerac in south-west France near Bordeaux.

Background: Life Itself started with a Gathering in summer 2016 with people coming together to dream and act to birth a new world. During these 8 years we have practiced, learned, grown and reflected together on what our current world is dying of and what are the seeds of the world to come. This gathering is for all the people looking to nurture the seeds of a second renaissance.

## What to expect?

A beautiful week of creativity, community, pragmatic philosophy and open space!

Here are some of the themes and workshops:  
- The second Renaissance the journey to an Awakening society 
- Embodied transformation with Performance  
- Art, Spirituality and Activism
- The climate crisis: beyond identity
- The politics of Being
- Play in life and life as play, 
- Ecstatic Dance 
- Music for connection & healing, 
- The collective body as the medium to reconnection

We will have rotating teams to share the roles of cooking, cleaning, and fun making.
