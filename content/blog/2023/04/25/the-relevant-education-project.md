The concept of the Revelavnt Education Project takes into account three predicates, firstly, humanity’s transition is inevitable, secondly, the transition will either be transformative or dystopian, and thirdly, an emergent systematic change is required to avoid a dystopian future. This transition will possibly occur during a 25 years timeframe. 

## The Presentation

The Relevant Education Project is about enabling people to participate in a sensible conversation in order to figure out what an individual’s role might be. This project is aimed at everyone from the age of 16 years to 116 years, and a particular focus is placed on making it accessible to the 16 years old as they are going to be the generation in the roles of authority in 25 years' time. 

Although it’s a purely educational project, it has three hidden agendas; the first is to engender the idea of questioning the very deeply established assumptions, conventions and categories. The second is to think and feel very differently. This includes wider, more inclusive perspectives, with an embodied sense of interconnection, which is related to having a deeper knowledge and understanding of the world around us. And finally, the whole thing is a trigger of emotions. This stems from the current situation we are in with respect to nature, the economy, society and our civilization. There is an accumulated fear and distrust which needs to be eliminated to restore the balance in our lives. 

How can humanity restore balance and prepare for the next transition? The idea of an embodied sense of connectedness includes the study and experiences of mysticism, and transcendence which collectively rise to the spiritual instinct. The spiritual instinct should be at the core of the transition and the project. 

The project is an extensive collection of research carried out by people over the years. The project includes the work of Ian McGilchrist on challenging the fundamentals about worldviews, philosophy, science, religion, and atmosphere as well as questioning the metaphysical stuff being, knowing, changing, becoming causing, meaning, purpose, and values.

The project engages people in the discussion on reviewing the past, examining the presence, the different perspectives on looking at history, different origin stories, understanding the  crisis, and making sense of the civilizational risks, risks faced with the AI, and meta risk. Deciding to act and flourish in the interpersonal space includes personal growth, the idea of personal development, and cultural development. 

This work is still in its developmental stages, some of the tasks are underway such as the research and writing of the book, and there is a lot of work needed on how the book will be shared with the world in an accessible way. The dissemination of this knowledge will be the second part of the project which will work on reaching the target audience. Humanity’s span of attention has been shortened and the book needs to be converted into videos, and articles and possibly made available on online educational platforms such as the Khan Academy.

❓The question ❓

What kind of future lies ahead for humanity? Is it transformative or dystopian? The answer lies in the collective awareness and actions of millions of people.  

There is a need for an “emergent systematic change” and this change will come by challenging the fundamentals, of our worldviews, philosophy, science, religion, and atmosphere and the metaphysical stuff,  being, knowing, changing, becoming, causing, meaning, purpose, values, things like that. 

>Alex has a background in Computer Science, Math and Theoretical Physics. Having found one of the first AI companies in the 1980s, Alex could see our civilizational shifts from early on. He introduced the ideas of Integral Theory/Philosophy to the Knowledge Management Forum at Henley Management College, and set up a project to apply Integral Theory to Knowledge Management.

Looking around us we can see that neither our society nor our planet is as well as it should be. Greater wisdom is needed both in diagnosis and in finding cures.

We emphasise wisdom because we believe this is about more than finding a quick fix in technology or politics — it is about finding something deeper within ourselves and our societies
