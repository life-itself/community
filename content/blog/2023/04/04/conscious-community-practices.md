Let's face the truth, most conscious communities fail. 

Not because they do not have a brilliant vision for bringing people together with shared values, to create a wiser, weller world. But because it is challenging to maintain a harmony within a group of people, when we each have shadows and ego which is not yet integrated. 

The Life Itself Praxis Hub takes a humble approach of grounding in the reality that our current society is geard towards individualism and these challenges can only be overcome by integrating this individualism with collectivism. 

In this discussion, Valerie Duvauchelle, co-founder of the Life Itself Praxis Hub in Bergerac, France speaks about how we can create a collective body through frameworks of shared practices that facilitates harmony within a community.

Valerie, shares about the framework that is used at our [[content/programs/index|Residencies]] and the reasons behind using this framework. This is followed by a discussion from the community around the topic of creating conscious community. 

What processes and practices do you think help communities thrive? Let us know in the comments on Youtube or in our [Whatsapp Chat](https://chat.whatsapp.com/JNJCTZugNQn).
