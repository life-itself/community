The 19th of October is World Values Day, a campaign set up to increase awareness and practical action related to values. So often we navigate our lives, and by default our value systems, unconsciously and that is why at Life Itself we thought we would use World Values Day to set up a community challenge! Welcome the October Values Rally: Fueling Conversations, Building Communities!

The purpose of this Rally is to instigate even more conscious connections within community, both ours and yours!

There will be two ways in which you can participate in the rally, through our live values conversations or through holding personal conversations within your own community. We encourage both but you can decide what works best for you.

More details will be released soon so be sure to check back!
