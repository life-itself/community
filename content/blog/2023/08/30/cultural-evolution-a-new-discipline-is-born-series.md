In the new Life Itself Podcast Series, Cultural Evolution: A New Discipline is Born, Rufus Pollock continues on the conversation with Professor Joseph Henrich on Culturology. 

Leading on from the original podcast episode, the 3 new episodes take us on a journey to better understand what makes humans successful, how culture both develops and impacts us on individual and societal levels, the fundamental differences between those who are WEIRD and those who aren't, and how family, religion and psychological factors have all played a significant role in developing and influencing cultural development. 

These thought-provoking conversations offer insight into the complexities of studying cultural evolution and human behavior and its far-reaching implications for various aspects of society and the development of creating a wiser, weller world. Leaving us contemplating where do we go from here?
