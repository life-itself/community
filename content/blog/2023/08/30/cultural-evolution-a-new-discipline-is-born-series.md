In this new Life Itself Podcast Series Rufus Pollock continues on the conversation with Professor Joseph Henrich on Culturology. Leading on from the original podcast episode, the 3 new episodes take us on a journey to better understand what makes humans successful, how culture both develops and impacts us on individual and societal levels, the fundamental differences between those who are WEIRD and those who aren't, and how family, religion and psychological factors have all played a significant role in developing and influencing cultural development. 

We are left contemplating where do we go from here, as the potential for this research area to gain even deeper traction in supporting the development of a wiser, weller world.

## What is Culturology?
Culturology is an interdisciplinary field that focuses on the study of culture and its various interrelated aspects. It encompasses the examination of how culture shapes and influences human behavior, beliefs, values, norms, practices, and expressions. Through the analysis of different forms of cultural production, such as literature, art, music, language, rituals, and the interdisciplinary areas such as history, politics, economics, technology, psychology, anthropology and sociology, culturology research supports the understanding of the development, and potential trajectory and impact of culture globally, locally and individually.

It plays an important role in uncovering the underlying meanings and influences that shape human experiences and societies, and provides a deeper appreciation and comprehension of the diverse cultures that exist in the world.

## About the series
In this epic series Cultural Evolution: A new discipline is born Rufus Pollock and Joseph Henrich discuss the development and evolution of culture, societies, human behavior and innovation.

Across the four episodes they dive into a wide range of subjects, including the concept of "cultural dark matter," the influence of religion and rituals on society, the role of trust and cooperation, the potential for tracking cultural innovation, the challenges of balancing individualism and collectivism, the potential for cross-fertilization among different intentional communities and more!

This thought-provoking conversation offers insights into the complexities of studying cultural evolution and human behavior and its far-reaching implications for various aspects of society.
