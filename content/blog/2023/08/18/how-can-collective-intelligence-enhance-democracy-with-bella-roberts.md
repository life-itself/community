We are delighted to invite Bella Roberts for our next community call.

In this call Bella will discuss how our democracy is in crisis. Through the proliferation of disinformation, fake news and now generative AI, it is even harder to know the "truth". In this mired information environment, it is tough to make decisions, especially during election time when we get to exercise the main democratic tool available to us, once every few years. In a deliberative democracy, our voices matter more than our votes. Through deliberation, consensus can be built amongst a shared understanding, trust and empathy. Collective intelligence describes a form of collective decision making, which is being increasingly enabled by technology - allowing people to participate at scale, from any location. However, deliberative technologies are soon becoming able to not only summarise, but recommend and predict what we say; therefore blurring the lines of agency between human input, and AI. How can we harness these technologies to empower the people and restore democracy, before its too late? Bella promises that she wrote this blurb, not ChatGPT.

At the start of 2021, Bella's life, in her own words, took a crazy turn when she decided to run for election for the London Assembly, leaving behind a decade in the finance industry. This was the first year that the UK had officially left the EU and the UK was in the midst of the COVID pandemic with no vaccine rollout plan. Everything seemed highly uncertain, and unpromising, but she wanted to take a stand. Like many others, she did not feel like they had a say and it felt like democracy was broken. Following the experience, she embarked on a Masters in Digital Politics which also had modules in AI and philosophy, leading her to present her main research project to you in this community call. She also studied the last two terms of her course remotely in Bali - but she'll tell you more on that later!
