In today's fast-paced world, many of us grapple with stress and information paralysis. In a world where the outside noise threatens to overwhelm us, reconnecting with what matters most and acting from a place of alignment matters more than ever. Join Jan, the founder of Inner Compass Academy, as he walks you through the origins of his life design approach and how it can be used to enact systemic change at both an individual and collective level.

Jan is the founder of Inner Compass, an online community that helps people connect more deeply with themselves, with others, and with their authentic life path. The seed of Inner Compass was planted when Jan was navigating a particularly stormy period of his life; the foundations on which his life rested had crumbled, and he was forced to put into question many of his existing beliefs. There were times he felt alone, confused, and directionless as he tried to make sense of the future he was moving towards.  With Inner Compass, it is his mission to empower people to navigate change from a place of alignment and integrity.
