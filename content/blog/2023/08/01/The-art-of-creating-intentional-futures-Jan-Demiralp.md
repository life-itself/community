_In today's fast-paced world, many of us grapple with stress and information paralysis. In a world where the outside noise threatens to overwhelm us, reconnecting with what matters most and acting from a place of alignment matters more than ever._

In this conversation, Jan Demiralp shares a simple, yet powerful 5-step process for creating intentional futures. When it comes to navigating major life changes, when the pillars of your life start shifting and you have to re-lay the foundations, this process can help do this. Equally so, you can use this in enhancing any choice into a conscious choice. 

The 5-step formula for conscious creation, includes intention, vision, awareness, strategy and action. Enquiry into each of these steps, ideally through contemplation and journalling, can bring focus, motivation and positive change into your life.

## About Jan

>Jan is the founder of Inner Compass, an online community that helps people connect more deeply with themselves, with others, and with their authentic life path. The seed of Inner Compass was planted when Jan was navigating a particularly stormy period of his life; the foundations on which his life rested had crumbled, and he was forced to put into question many of his existing beliefs. There were times he felt alone, confused, and directionless as he tried to make sense of the future he was moving towards. With Inner Compass, it is his mission to empower people to navigate change from a place of alignment and integrity.Â
