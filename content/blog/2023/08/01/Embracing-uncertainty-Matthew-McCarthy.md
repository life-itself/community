We are delighted to invite Matthew McCarthy to join us for this community call.

In this call Matthew will be discussing a few recent trends in transdisciplinary research, and talking about the importance of uncertainty in navigating and making sense of these trends.Â With a mechanistic view of the world slowly but surely being replaced by a more relational, holistic, and complex view of the world, how should we consider what we can be certain of, or not certain of, in developing this worldview, particularly in the context of the meta crisis?

Matthew is a transdisciplinary researcher at Life Itself. He also works closely with CLEA, where he helps to coordinate the systemic modelling group and explores how to model complex processes. He studied urban studies at Vrije Universiteit Brussel, and is primarily focused on both developing and strengthening the knowledge networks to help transition to a more open, stable, and meaningful world.
