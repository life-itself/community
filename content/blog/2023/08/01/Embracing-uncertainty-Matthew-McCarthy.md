In this community call, Matthew and fellow life itself community members discuss a few dimensions of uncertainty, especially as it relates to trans disciplinary research. In doing so, they discuss the nature of the trans disciplinary project more generally, as the shift from a mechanistic worldview to a more relational worldview, and as a reassessment for different ways of knowing and different ways of producing and applying knowledge. It is also emphasized that the dunning-kruger effect can be happening on a wider cultural scale, and that currently, we should meditate more deeply on uncertainty in its many dimensions in the effort to establish wiser ways of being.
