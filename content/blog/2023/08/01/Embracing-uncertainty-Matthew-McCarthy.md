We are delighted to invite Matthew McCarthy to join us for this community call.


In this call Matthew will be discussing a few recent trends in transdisciplinary research, and talking about the importance of uncertainty in navigating and making sense of these trends.Â 

With a mechanistic view of the world slowly but surely being replaced by a more relational, holistic, and complex view of the world, how should we consider what we can be certain of, or not certain of, in developing this worldview, particularly in the context of the meta crisis?
