Letâ€™s dive straight in and explore the top 3 benefits of conscious coliving.

## Benefit #1 More people = more support + deeper connections

Choosing to live in a wider community, organized in pre-agreed ways means that connection to one and another is an integral part that facilitates the flourishing of a community. This connection can provide a stronger support system to navigate life's ups and downs, including connecting to others on a deeper level and providing emotional and psychological support.Â 

Intentional communities can also be great for parenting, and raising the future generation, because as the Ancient African proverb says _it takes a village to raise a child_. Traditional communities have known for eons that raising a child takes a village of support, not just one or two parental figures.Â 

Unfortunately, today the (extended) family unit and societal structures donâ€™t seem to be providing the support needed to raise children, or help parents navigate this role. Everyone is busier, with conflicting priorities, that despite the best intentions means parenting can often feel like a hugely challenging experience. Having a ready made village can at least help to offset that.Â 

Community living has also been linked to increased longevity and better overall health.  It can also help to combat the loneliness pandemic affecting so many today by helping to foster a sense of connection and belonging.

## Benefit #2: It can positively contribute to financial and environmental sustainability

The beauty of coliving means that things are shared! Which can have a wonderful impact both personally and environmentally.

Sharing costs of living, rent, or even in some cases clubbing together to individually buy a proportion of a property, can help individuals to create a more financially sustainable lifestyle than simply doing it alone. This can be appealing to individuals who in the current circumstances are struggling to get on the property ladder, and/or donâ€™t want to live miles away from loved ones and community to do so.

Living in a conscious community also helps with consuming less resources and producing less waste. Communal gardens, permaculture designs, or even simply sharing resources such as a carpool, food, or clothing exchanges, allows conscious coliving and intentional communities to support a more sustainable lifestyle for the individual and the planet.Â 

## Benefit #3: More opportunities to live your dharma

Who doesnâ€™t want to live a more aligned life? To contribute in a way that honors your highest expression, or at least offers you an opportunity to try and discover what that expression is?Â 

Dharma simply means life purpose. In intentional and conscious communities you will be exposed to different ways of thinking, new skills and new opportunities to learn, grow and develop. These can all support you as you navigate through life trying to understand more deeply what you came here to do.

It is only through having experiences outside of your comfort zone that you can really gain more knowledge and insight into yourself. This might include clues around what skills you want to develop or explore, and also what you enjoy! Within conscious and intentional communities you may also find you take on a different role than you have been used to and this can help you to discover more about yourself and your purpose.Â

_Finally, just in case you arenâ€™t sure what conscious coliving is here is a little overview_ ðŸ˜‰

> To be conscious you need to have an awareness of an internal and external existence. To have both knowledge and be able to respond (instead of react) to your surroundings. We consider this to include an aspect of inner development and an awareness of one's impact on their surroundings and world. A coliver is quite simply someone who lives with others and this can be in a variety of ways.
