In our [[conscious-coliving-course|Conscious Coliving 101 course]], we explore the most common myths about conscious coliving situations. 

We are conditioned by movies and pop culture to think that intentional communities are some kind of hippy cult thing that we should steer away from at all costs! But of course, if you’re reading this you probably know that this isn’t true. At least not usually. 

Cults do exist though and there have historically been a lot of crazy stories about intentional communities gone wrong. Most of the time these cults start with good intentions and as they grow things take a turn for the worse. 

In hindsight, the red flags are there from the beginning and we cover these red flags in our [[conscious-coliving-course|course]]. 

The problem is when you join a cult, you mostly don’t realise it until it's too late! The red flags are there, but the ideals of a utopian society far outweigh that niggling sense that something is not quite right and you carry on.  
  
It doesn’t have to be this way though. One of the best ways to make sure you don’t join a cult is to learn the inner workings of other cults - because while cults tend to have different belief systems, they usually follow a similar pattern.  
  
This list of 5 documentaries about cults has been selected because they involve “intentional” communities and if you (binge) watch them all you will be thoroughly clued up on cults and how to avoid them. 

## 1. How to Become a Cult Leader

*Where to watch*: Netflix 
*Year Released*: 2023

Despite the ironic title and narrative, this 6-part docu–series that came out in June, 2023 is a thorough exploration of cults and the psychology of cult leaders. It tries to make light of a dark topic, by pretending that its audience is trying to start a cult, however the insights are just as useful (if not more) at learning what to avoid. 

## 2. Wild Wild Country

*Where to watch*: Netflix
*Year released*: 2018

Rajneeshpuram, was an intentional community developed on an old ranch in Wasco County, Oregon, USA by devotees of Osho, known then as Rajneesh or Bhagwan. The ranch was developed into a city that held a population up to 7000 people during its heyday between 1981 and 1988. This docu-series follows the story from Osho’s humble beginnings to the rampant…. Well I won’t spoil it for you, but it’s worth a watch before signing up to follow a spiritual leader to the USA!

## 3. Heavens Gate: The Cult of Cults

*Where to watch*: HBO Max
*Year released*: 2020 

Although not entirely centered around an “intentional” community, Heaven Gate cult leaders Ti and Do persuaded almost 100 people to go underground together. They lived and breathed the Heavens Gate ideology that rather than dying they could become immortalized as aliens in a utopian alien paradise. It is pretty far out, but people actually signed up! Needless to say it didn’t end well, but you will have to watch it to discover why. 

## 4. Jonestown: The Life and Death of Peoples Temple

https://youtu.be/6S_d1eVv0E8


*Where to watch*: [On youtube]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=traRRAQQfbg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=traRRAQQfbg)) 
*Year released*: 2006 

Culminating in the largest mass suicide in history the Peoples Temple “intentional” community, Jonestown, in Guyana met it’s sorry end in 1978. Named after the cult leader Jim Jones (a huge red flag) the communist community became home for almost 1000 people. This documentary explores how communities can take a turn for the worse. 

## 5. Holy Hell

https://youtu.be/2f2BG43JW0o

*Where to watch*: Amazon 
*Year released*: 2016

Director Will Allen, spent 22 years as the videographer for Jaime Gomez, spiritual teacher and leader of the Buddhafield cult - not to be confused with the U.K. based Buddhist organization included in our ecosystem map. Jaime's alluring utopian vision enabled him to grow his following - don’t get caught out by the same. Ironically, he also called it an anti-cult. An anti-cult utopian community, where do we sign up? 

## Don't join a cult 

As you will discover from watching these documentaries, there are common threads between all cults, including a charismatic leader with no equal, a lofty, often outrageous vision for the future and an eventual demise.   

Don’t join a cult! Watch these documentaries, get clued up and join a real intentional community instead. If you need more insights about community living done right join our free [[conscious-coliving-course|Conscious Coliving 101]] course as well.
