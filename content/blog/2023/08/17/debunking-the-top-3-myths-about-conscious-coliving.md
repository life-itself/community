There are many myths regarding what conscious coliving environments or communities look like, here we bust the top 3.

## Myth #1: Utopian Paradise Awaits You 

Intentional communities are often seen as idyllic utopias where harmony and happiness prevail. However, it's important to recognize that intentional communities, like any group of individuals, are not immune to conflict. Differing opinions, personalities, and priorities can lead to disagreements and challenges. Achieving harmony in a community requires constant effort, effective communication, and the willingness to compromise.

Being in an intentional community also does not make you automatically conscious. So being surrounded by people who are working to walk the talk is important. This also helps to manage the conflict that will inevitably arise and ironically will help you to get closer towards a utopian paradise. But you've got to do the work, internally and outwardly. 

## Myth #2: Goodbye, Personal Space 

Some people fear that living in an intentional community means sacrificing personal space. However, many intentional communities strike a balance between communal and private spaces. While there may be shared areas and resources, individuals still have the opportunity to have their own personal sanctuaries. It is possible to find a sense of solitude and autonomy within a communal living arrangement. So you don’t need to worry about having to share your partner, your toothbrush or somebody else’s stress! 

Any highly functioning community knows that a well balanced sense of privacy with the communal elements is actually what helps the community thrive longer term. 

## Myth #3: Goodbye, Ambition and Success 

The idea of conforming to a greater good predefined by that one charismatic leader is often what can spring to mind when the topic of intentional communities comes up. 

Another common misconception is that you are simply trying to avoid responsibility. As far as we know, healthy communities do not diminish the ambition and success of an individual, they simply nurture it in a different way providing environments for personal growth and the pursuit of goals. 

Many intentional communities foster a culture of learning, collaboration, and innovation, offering opportunities to pursue passions and make a positive impact more widely. Within the right intentional community, ambition and success can be redefined to encompass holistic well-being and purposeful living that serves all.

Remember, intentional communities are shaped by the complexities of human interactions and experiences. By dispelling these myths, you can approach the idea of living consciously in an intentional community with a more balanced and realistic perspective.
