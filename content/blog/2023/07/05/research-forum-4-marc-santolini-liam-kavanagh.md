In this call, Marc and Liam will lead a discussion on how an extreme citizen science of contemplation can be built, bringing together the wisdom of ancient contemplative practices and the rigor of modern scientific methodologies.

Marc Santolini is a research fellow at the Learning Planet Institute (Université Paris Cité), Co-director of Life Itself Research and co-founder of the Life Itself Praxis Hub. With a background in network science and epistemology, his work focuses on innovation, collaboration, and learning within open and citizen science communities. As a core resident of the Praxis Hub, Marc investigates how collective practices impact relational well-being and foster group self-regulatory processes. 

Liam Kavanagh is a Cognitive & Social Scientist devoted to using his understanding of human motivation, ideology, and economics to aid more effective responses to the climate crisis. He has worked on three continents over 20 years doing applied social research, co-founded Life Itself, a community for responding to the poly-crisis, and written a book on how Western ideology contributes to climate change inaction.
