This community call will focus on the concept of multi-level resilience building capacity, from individual neurons to entire nations. The core idea is to understand how we have evolved pathways for feeling safe and good, and by comprehending these pathways on neurological, social, and societal levels, we can optimise and "hack" into them. This optimisation allows us to enhance resilience at the individual, group, and societal levels, enabling us to effectively face complex problems, cope, collaborate and engage with the world in grounded and stable ways. By strengthening these pathways, we can lead more meaningful and connected lives.
