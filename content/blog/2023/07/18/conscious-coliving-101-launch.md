Anyone who has been following Life Itself will know that living in community is one of the foundational practices that we advocate for to create a wiser, weller world. From community breeds collective wisdom and consciousness which fundamentally changes culture. 

Community also create a space for innovation, a possibility for people to come together and ponder the great challenges of our time and find solutions. So, the solutions appear when humans connect the dots together. 

With that in mind we have spent the last month creating a free introductory course about conscious coliving. This 6-day email mini-course is for people who are considering or have just begun to live in community and are ready to dive deeper into consciously coliving.
