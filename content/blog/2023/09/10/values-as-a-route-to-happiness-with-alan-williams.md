We are delighted to invite Alan Williams for our next community call.

In this call Alan will open up the conversation around values, ahead of our [October Values Rally](https://lifeitself.org/blog/2023/08/30/october-values-rally), by discussing how values can be a route to happiness. 

Do you want to be more comfortable with who you are and feel less stressed? Do you want to be the best version of you? Do you want to be happy? For most of us, "Yes" is an easy answer to these questions, but to achieve this in practice is more of a challenge. There is another way. How many people do you know who invest time, effort and money in going to the gym or fitness classes or personal trainers as a way to improve their physical fitness? What if you paid similar attention and commitment to supporting and guiding the way you think, feel and behave in a more holistic way? What positive impact could there be? What negative feelings could be reduced? Just imagine – how would you feel if you knew what was important to you and how to make decisions based on and behave in line with these things? 

The My 31Practices approach is a very simple way to help identify and articulate personal values and then bring these values to life through a set of very practical behaviours. It is an approach based on doing a little every day with mindfulness, internalisation, imprinting and positive reinforcement of your desired behaviour.

Please bring to the call a value that is important to you or one that you would like to explore in more depth, to aid the discussion.
