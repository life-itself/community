## The conversation

For the past few months, Life Itself has been  working on our [Deliberately Developmental Spaces project](Building the Field for Developmental Spaces: a new project in collaboration with Fetzer Institute, Commonweal & Ekskäret (lifeitself.org) which aims to bring together stakeholders, ecologies of practice, innovations, funders, and other relevant resources as it relates to ‘deliberately developmental spaces’. This project materialized out of the growing realization that systemic transformation on a social scale relies on deep inner transformation. And so, we think that ‘deliberately developmental spaces’ might have a meaningful role in addressing the meta crisis, and this project aims to bring together some of the practices and organizations that might be meaningful to coalesce the field. 

During the community call, we invite our community members along with anyone else interested in such a to both learn about the project and give feedback on what kind of next steps might be meaningful. We see this project as a first step in the emergence of a new field.
