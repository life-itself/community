For the past six months, Life Itself has been  working on our [Deliberately Developmental Spaces project](https://lifeitself.org/blog/2023/06/20/building-field-for-developmental-spaces) which aims to bring together stakeholders, ecologies of practice, innovations, funders, and other relevant resources as it relates to ‘deliberately developmental spaces’. This project materialized out of the growing realization that systemic transformation on a social scale relies on deep inner transformation. And so, we think that ‘deliberately developmental spaces’ might have a meaningful role in addressing the meta crisis, and this project aims to bring together some of the practices and organizations that might be meaningful to coalesce the field. 

During the community call, we invited our community members along with anyone else interested to both learn about the project and give feedback on what kind of next steps might be meaningful.

> We call for the creation of "deliberately developmental spaces" that cultivate the psychological and cultural capacities to respond effectively to the growing crises before us. These spaces can take many forms ranging from courses or programs to physical environments including new forms of monasteries or universities.
