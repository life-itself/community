Conflict is a natural part of communal living. It's not uncommon for clashes to arise due to differing personalities and lifestyles. Engaging in open communication, or mediation when necessary, allows you to express your concerns while actively listening to the other person's perspective.

If you have any specific concerns, always speak with the lead organizers of the community you are considering and find out what measures they have in place.

Conscious coliving often prioritizes sustainability and eco-friendliness. Many communities implement recycling programs, energy-efficient practices, and may even incorporate renewable energy sources.
