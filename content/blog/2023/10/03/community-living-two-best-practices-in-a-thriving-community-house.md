In 2003, Myka moved to Boulder Colorado to work with Ken Wilber. She started a community house with seven other people - most of whom were also there to work with Ken. The community house was wildly successful and thrived for eleven years, with over 50 people living there across this period. The community ended only because the owner sold the house. 

In this Life Itself Community Call, Myka shares the wisdom she has learnt from this experience and the two key things that she believes were the foundations for why the house thrived for so long practically, financially and interpersonally.  She covers:

* The two best practices that made the community house thrive for the long-term 
* Why these two practices were so essential for diminishing issues in the most vulnerable times in a community house
* How these two best practices cut out many interpersonal and financial issues that can destroy community houses
* Considerations for how these best practices might be used to design an ownership structure for a land/house purchase
* Open discussion from attendees about best practices you are/have experienced that makes your community living projects thrive, so we can all share resources
