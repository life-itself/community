We are excited to announce the first **Life Itself Research Hackathon**, a chance to come together to work on projects and ideas connected with the [[content/research|Life Itself Research Community]]. It will take place on Saturday 3rd June 2023 ([what's a hackathon?](#what-is-a-hackathon)).

Our focus will be **prototyping introductory reading lists, curricula and knowledge maps** for the key ideas and concepts related to bringing forth a radically wiser, weller world üåç -- [read more below üëá](#theme-for-the-hackathon).

This is a free event open to all and you can join online -- or in person if you want to come to our [[../../../../hubs/bergerac|Bergerac Hub]]. If you're interested, fill out the registration form:

## Theme for the hackathon

This hackathon focuses on prototyping introductory reading lists, curricula and knowledge maps for the key ideas and concepts related to making a radically wiser, weller world üåç.

You are also welcome to bring your own ideas and projects connected with our broader [research community topics](https://lifeitself.org/research#topics).

#### Reading lists and curricula

We want to create [[../../../../notes/reading-lists-hackathon-project|reading-lists-hackathon-project|simple reading lists for key ideas and background]] in our emerging field.

The goal is to help direct people towards high quality learning resources around particular topic areas. e.g. answering questions such as "How can I learn about topic X as a newcomer?" and "What are the canonical texts for topic X?".

Some inspiration for this (not in our area but showing the kind of idea):

- [Places Journal reading lists](https://placesjournal.org/reading-lists/)
- [LessWrong library](https://www.lesswrong.com/library)
- [notion reading lists](https://parameter.io/notion-reading-list-templates/)
- [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/system-design)

#### Knowledge maps

The reading lists connect with a broader effort to create **high-level knowledge map**: that is interactive knowledge maps and visualization that show the key topics and themes and how they fit together. This answers questions like: "What topics should you learn about if you want to engaged with this kind of work?" and "What topics are adjacent or related to topic X e.g. inner development?"

## FAQs

### What skills should I have to attend?

Curiosity is the only essential skill.

You do **not** need a background in research or academia.

### What if I don't have a project?

No worries! We will have projects you can join.

### What if I have an idea for a project that's outside of the theme?

Great! Let us know in the registration form.

### Can I join for part of the day?

Yes! You are welcome to join for any part of the day or pre-days.

### When are the pre-days?

If you're interested in joining for any of the pre-days, let us know in the registration form and we'll be in touch.

### What is a hackathon?

A hackathon (also known as a hack day; a portmanteau of hacking and marathon) is an event where people engage in rapid and collaborative engineering over a relatively short period of time such as 24 or 48 hours. As this event is hosted by the Life Itself Research community we will be working on research projects that aren't exclusively confined to coding.
