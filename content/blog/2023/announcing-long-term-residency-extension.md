This fall we've been doing things a little bit different at our hub in Southwestern France. What is usually a space for shorter residencies around specific topics has opened its doors to explorers willing to join conscious community longer-term.

## Come Join Us!

**We are happy to share that our long-term residency at the Bergerac Hub has been extended** and will run **until the 31st March 2024.** This residency is held by a lightweight developmental frame, where residents benefit from experiencing the joy of conscious coliving, whilst still having time to focus on their own work.

Come and feel nourished this winter by gathering alongside like-minded souls curious to experiment with practices of communal living. If you are interested in spending anything from 2 weeks to up to 3 months in our community in Southwest France, **you can send in a quick application through** [**this form**](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdiykDKyZR6DgtPKeYuNePy9sWc-qkIc4BVfKBRjkFWKvFp-g/viewform)**.** Spots are filling up fast!

## How It's Going

Wrapping up the first month of the long-term residency, the participants, most of whom came from city living, have been able to take a breath as we have fallen into a soothing routine enabled by the lightweight frame of a few communal practices. If you would like to dive deeper, here is a sneak peak of hub guardian Alexia’s reflections on the rhythm and atmosphere of the fall residency…   
 

_As the season of integration is embedding itself into the town, bringing with it falling leaves and shorter days, we too relax deeper into a communal processing of what was, in order to make space for what may come to be. The flora and fauna around us are adapting to ensure survival through the winter, and we too are re-evaluating our non-negotiables. Here, at the Bergerac hub, we are glad to be satisfying our need of being part of a community which lights us up as the sun fades more and more._
