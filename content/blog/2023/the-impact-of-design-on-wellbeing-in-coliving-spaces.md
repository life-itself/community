Explore the transformative influence of design on the well-being of conscious co-living residents, from the strategic use of natural light to the integration of sustainable practices and innovative technology. This article is a great resource for anyone interested in designing or updating their own coliving space.


In the evolving landscape of modern living, conscious co-living has emerged as a lifestyle choice that prioritises community, sustainability, and well-being. As we delve into the intricacies of intentional communal living, it becomes evident that the design of these spaces plays a pivotal role in shaping the overall well-being of their residents. From the gentle interplay of natural light to the psychology of colours and thoughtful layout strategies, each design element contributes to a canvas where well-being stands at the forefront.


### The Psychological Impact of Colours

The psychological impact of colours is crucial in shaping the ambiance and well-being of residents in co-living spaces. Intentional use of calming tones like blues and greens promotes relaxation, while vibrant hues in common areas encourage social interaction. For example in the Bergerac Hub bright cobalt blue, soft sage green and vibrant yellow can be prominently found within communal areas like the dining room and dojo promoting an environment that is both soothing and enlivening. This understanding of colour theory allows coliving communities like the Hub to design spaces that meet both emotional and functional needs, enriching the overall living experience of members. 

### Functional Layouts for Practical Living

Efficient layouts are a crucial part of co-living spaces, facilitating smooth transitions between private and communal areas. Prioritising efficiency streamlines residents' daily activities, contributing to a harmonious living experience. 

The intentional integration of versatile furniture, like sofa beds and modular shelving, highlights a commitment to adaptable design. Thoughtfully designed furnishings allow residents to tailor their living spaces to their needs. These layouts go beyond convenience, creating environments that balance individual needs with collective experiences for a fulfilling living atmosphere.

 An exemplary case is The Collective Old Oak in London, where strategic use of sliding doors and adaptable furnishings transforms living areas based on residents' dynamic needs, emphasising the importance of responsive design in practical communal living.

### Integrated Indoor-Outdoor Design 
 
Promoting a seamless connection between indoor and outdoor spaces is crucial for enhancing residents' well-being, encouraging outdoor activities for a more enriched living experience. Drawing on the insights of architect Christopher Alexander, known for his holistic approach in co-living space design, we find a key reference point for conscious design. Alexander's theories extend beyond aesthetics, actively contributing to residents' mental well-being and community cohesion. These principles can be seen in pracrtice in the [Bergerac Praxis Hub] [https://lifeitself.org/hubs/bergerac](https://lifeitself.org/hubs/bergerac), a unique co-living space near a river and serene park, allowing residents to live closely with nature. The intentional design seamlessly connects interior and exterior spaces, integrating outdoor activities and social interactions into daily life. Inspired by Alexander's principles, the intentional blending of indoor and outdoor spaces in the hub creates environments supporting a unique blend of collective and private experiences, fostering a conscious and harmonious living atmosphere.

### Why Natural Light So Important

Natural light plays a fundamental role in shaping the well-being of co-living residents, moving beyond its aesthetic appeal to become a crucial aspect of design.

In spaces like Common in Brooklyn, architects purposefully employ abundant sunlight through large windows, fostering an inviting atmosphere that positively impacts residents' circadian rhythms, mood, and productivity. The placement of these windows is purposeful, aiming to positively influence residents' circadian rhythms. This alignment with natural cycles fosters a living environment that supports the well-being of the residents. These design choices directly contribute to a positive mood and infuse the living spaces with warmth and vitality and reflect a commitment to creating a living space that considers the residents' physical and emotional well-being.

In conclusion, the intricate dance of design elements within conscious coliving spaces reveals itself as a silent yet transformative force. From the embrace of natural light to the nuanced impact of colour psychology and the seamless integration of indoor-outdoor realms, every detail plays a role in crafting environments that prioritise the well-being of their residents. As we reflect on the intentional choices made in these communal spaces, it becomes evident that design is not merely an aesthetic endeavour but a powerful catalyst for fostering connection, tranquillity, and a sense of purpose.
