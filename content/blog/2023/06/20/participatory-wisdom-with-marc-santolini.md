In this discussion, lead by systems scientist and Life Itself Praxis Hub co-founder, Marc Santolini, we explore the intersection between contemplative practices and scientific research, specifically in the context of impact-driven initiatives and citizen science projects. 

## The Conversation

Marc emphasizes the importance of participation and inclusion of stakeholders in order to achieve sustainable development goals and enable collaborative action. The role of contemplative practices in increasing relational well-being, both in terms of self-relationships and relationships with others and the world is important to research to provide better frameworks for this to occur. 

Marc describes his work at the Life Itself hub, where the praxis research team investigate the effects of contemplative practices on individuals and explore the interface between contemplative practices and scientific methodology. The goal is to create frameworks for sharing practices and insights, making them more accessible and replicable. Marc proposes a new epistemology for a meta-modern science that integrates contemplative practices and diverse forms of knowing, while also considering the importance of dialogue and participatory approaches.
