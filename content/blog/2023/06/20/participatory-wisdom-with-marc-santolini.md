We are delighted to invite Marc Santolini to join us for our next community call.

In this discussion we will explore the concept of participatory wisdom. Marc will inquire into how an extreme citizen science of contemplation can be built, bringing together the wisdom of ancient contemplative practices and the rigor of modern scientific methodologies.

Marc is a research fellow at the Learning Planet Institute (Université Paris Cité) and co-founder of the Life Itself Praxis Hub. With a background in network science and epistemology, his work focuses on innovation, collaboration, and learning within open and citizen science communities. As a core resident of the Praxis Hub, Marc investigates how collective practices impact relational well-being and foster group self-regulatory processes.
