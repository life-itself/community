In this discussion we explore some of the motivation behind, and primary goals for, the Climate Majority Project. 

## The Conversation

 Liam will present The Climate Majority Project which aims to empower and mobilize a majority of climate-conscious individuals in the UK by helping them recognize their collective strength and take meaningful action that is relevant to their own lives and communities. In addition to promoting practical steps, CMP emphasizes the significance of cultivating supportive cultures, political inclusivity, and resilience. By fostering a sense of unity and collaboration, the goal is to collectively confront the challenges posed by climate change. 

Liam Kavanagh is a Cognitive & Social Scientist devoted to using his understanding of human motivation, ideology, and economics to aid more effective responses to the climate crisis. He has worked on three continents over 20 years doing applied social research, co-founded Life Itself, a community for responding to the poly-crisis, and written a book on how Western ideology contributes to climate change inaction.
