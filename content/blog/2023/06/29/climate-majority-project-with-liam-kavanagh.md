## The Conversation

Traditional activism is not fully engaging the population, so the Climate Majority Project aims to create a space for those who want to act differently, with the same urgency as Extinction Rebellion but without the aggressive cultural tone. 

The project aims to create a visible rallying point for a diverse group of people to form a united front in climate action. Liam refers to the importance of addressing the "silent majority," those who feel underrepresented by the current climate movement, and reaching them through credible, inclusive, and action-oriented methods. 

Liam also highlights the need to handle negative news about climate change carefully and suggests creating an environment where people feel empowered to take relevant actions collectively. 

They emphasise the importance of providing a sense of shared endeavour and coherence to motivate people to take part in climate action. 

Overall, the Climate Majority Project seeks to create a mobilisation effort akin to historical wartime efforts but initiated at the grassroots level, appealing to a broad spectrum of society and promoting meaningful responses to the ecological emergency.
