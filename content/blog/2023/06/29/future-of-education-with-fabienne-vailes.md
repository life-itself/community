Participants engaged in a discussion and mutually explored the urgent need for change in education systems worldwide. They emphasised the importance of empowering individuals to navigate their educational and career paths based on their values and aspirations. The discussion highlighted the limitations of the traditional approach, which often leads to dissatisfaction and a lack of fulfilment later in life. Instead, participants advocated for cultivating self-awareness and values as a foundation for decision-making.

The dialogue sheds light on the evolving landscape of education, emphasising the growing mismatch between traditional schooling and the skills required for the future job market. The consensus among the participants was that a paradigm shift is necessary, which should focus on fostering curiosity, creativity, and lifelong learning.

The participants highlight the importance of curated resources and authentic connections, emphasising the power of relationships and encounters in shaping one's path. They envision a collective space that connects innovators and disruptors in education, facilitating collaboration and the exchange of ideas.

By empowering individuals to navigate their unique patterns, fostering self-awareness, and embracing lifelong learning, a transformative landscape of education can be created.
