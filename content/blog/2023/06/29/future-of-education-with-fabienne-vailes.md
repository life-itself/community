We are delighted to invite Fabienne Vailes to join us for our next community call.

In this discussion we will explore the future of education. The current education system failed us, so what are we gonna do about it? Fabienne brings a grounded and pragmatic approach to modern education with her Flourishing Student Model. 

Fabienne is first of all a mother of two teenage boys aged 15 and 13. She is also an Author, Educator, Podcaster and Researcher (PhD Candidate) exploring how individuals, communities and the planet ALL flourish; one imperfectly perfect conversation at a time. Additionally, she is co-founder of Streams Learning Hub for teenagers in Bristol, bringing a whole range of local in-person and global online opportunities.
