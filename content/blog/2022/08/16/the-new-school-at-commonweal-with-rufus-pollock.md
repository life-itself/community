## _Meet the MetaModerns: Emerging Movement with Alternative Approach to Social Change_

https://youtu.be/b9aLCCmcvJ4

This week, as part of our Exploring Social Transformation series, we're delighted to be sharing a conversation courtesy of the [New School at Commonweal](https://tns.commonweal.org/) with Life Itself co-founder, [Rufus Pollock](https://rufuspollock.com/).

In this conversation, Rufus Pollock sits down with host, [Michael Lerner](https://www.commonweal.org/staff/michael-lerner/), to discuss Life Itself's recent work [mapping an emerging “metamodern” ecosystem](https://ecosystem.lifeitself.org/) centered on a radical, alternative approach to social change - one that is simultaneously paradigmatic, integrated, and engaged.
