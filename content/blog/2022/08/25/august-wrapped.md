Welcome to our August newsletter! Here at the Life Itself Bergerac Hub, we've been hosting our "Light, Shadow, Integration" residency. While enjoying the late summer sun and the cooling Dordogne river, we've been dwelling deeply in the present moment and re-exploring our relationship with the intellect. We've been considering, how do we acknowledge our culture’s overrating of thought and theory, and the associated trauma, without getting caught in anti-thought and delusion (which are thoughts)? How do we discuss all the stuff that fills our heads without re-traumatising ourselves?

Behind the scenes, the team organizing our autumn Embodying Collective Transformation residencies have been hard at work getting everything ready for three months of collective transformation. The first residency kicks off in just a week(!) and the team are getting excited to welcome our first cohort of attendees into our beautiful hub.

Keep reading for information on more upcoming events, our latest podcast episodes, and an exciting job opportunity.

Best wishes,

Eilidh, Communications Associate 💛

## Crypto Policy Symposium 2022

Over the past six months, Life Itself Labs have been embarking on a project of research into and rigorous analysis of [web3 & crypto](https://web3.lifeitself.org/). One of our partners in this project, [Stephen Diehl](https://www.stephendiehl.com/), is speaking at the inaugural Crypto Policy Symposium on the 5th & 6th of September, 2022.

The Crypto Policy Symposium will be held online and in London. The  
symposium will be keynoted by two leaders on financial policy from the United States and the United Kingdom. This event is organized by a transnational coalition of academics, technologists and focused on public policy solutions to issues surrounding crypto assets.

The key objective of this conference is to help public sector policy makers and corporate decision makers to go beyond the hype and understand the reality of the crypto economy and its implications. By connecting experts with key decision makers, the hope is that this will inform better decisions regarding this sector, strengthen our democratic institutions, and advance public sense-making on these complex issues. Discussions on policy recommendations, systemic risk, prevention of regulatory capture, and critiques covering cryptocurrencies, ICOs, NFTs, DeFi, “Web3” and blockchains will be covered. This conference brings together the best minds in journalism, law, policy, technology, regulation and banking for two days of panel discussions and community building.
