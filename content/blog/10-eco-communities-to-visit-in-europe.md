Discover Europe's inspiring eco communities and ecovillages with us. Join our journey through 10 remarkable intentional communities that redefine our connection with the environment, emphasising sustainability and conscious co-living.

In an era marked by ecological sustainability concerns and a growing desire for conscious co-living, eco communities have emerged as beacons of hope and inspiration. These intentional communities embody the principles of eco-consciousness, emphasising sustainability, communal living, and harmonious coexistence with the environment. Europe boasts a diverse tapestry of eco communities pioneering innovative ways of sustainable living. From the lush hills of Ireland to the sun-soaked landscapes of Portugal, join us on a journey through 10 remarkable European eco communities reshaping our relationship with the planet.

But before we dive in, let's understand the distinction between an ecovillage and an eco community. 

An ecovillage is an intentional, traditional, or urban community consciously designing its pathway through locally owned, participatory processes, aiming to address the Ecovillage Principles taken from [The Global Ecovillage Network](https://ecovillage.org/ecovillages/) in the four areas of regeneration (social, culture, ecology, economy) into a whole systems design. 

On the other hand, an eco community has a broader scope and may encompass a variety of intentional communities prioritising ecological sustainability but may not strictly adhere to the ecovillage model. Eco communities can include intentional neighbourhoods, co-housing projects, or even urban communities with a shared commitment to eco-friendly practices.
