Anyone who has lived in a conscious community or taken time to learn about them knows that conflict is a natural part of communal living. With this in mind we’ve created a course to help you discover invaluable insights and strategies to navigate and embrace conflict, fostering harmonious and thriving intentional communities and coliving spaces.

In the dynamic realm of conscious coliving, one cannot escape the reality of conflict—a real-time, ever-present force shaping the fabric of our shared existence. Our new course, Transforming Conflict in Community, sets the scene, unraveling the intricacies of conflict and its potential impact on communal harmony. As we navigate this exploration, we learn that embracing the discomfort of conflict becomes the gateway to profound revelations, opportunities and growth.

With this in mind and after polling the Life Itself Community, we carefully crafted our second free introductory course on Transforming Conflict in Community. This 7-day email course is tailored for those individuals entering, currently in, or navigating conflict within community and coliving situations, seeking empowerment and enhanced conflict resolution skills. It delves into the origins of conflict, and offers insights and strategies for maintaining harmony in community.
