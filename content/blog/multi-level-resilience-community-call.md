## About the call

We are multi-dimensional beings, and it therefore takes an ecology of practices to build resiliency in the face of all the different ways we suffer. 

In this community call Boaz took the participants through an exploration of how we can collectively build a field of safety, authenticity and enjoyment through gradually enable more co-creative ways to contain the group space; going from from being an observer, to participating, to leading the session! In this call 2 skills were practiced: 

1. Self-regulation: finding ways to connect to our inner experience and feel better. We’ll do some mindfulness, gratitude and compassion practices. 

2. Co-regulation: we’ll be together in real-time, and explore the felt-sense experience of our relational experience, what’s happening for each of us as we listen to others, and share ourselves about our experience. We’ll practice how we can be ourselves authentically in the group, while also remain connected to the group (because often in our lives it’s either/or)! 

This call was a teaser, ahead of the up and upcoming residency Boaz is leading in June 16-30 2024 at the Bergerac Hub, [more details here](https://neurosystemics.org/simple-event/relational-embodiment-residency/)

## About Boaz

Boaz B. Feldman (MSc, SEP, FSP, PgD) is a pragmatic visionary, clinical psychologist, trainer, researcher and contemplative acting for worldwide positive change. A depression in his early 20’s led him to ordain as a Buddhist monk in Thailand, where he practiced mindfulness meditation intensively for 3 years. He then returned to Switzerland, graduating from the University of Geneva’s Integrative Clinical Psychology Masters, and led a number of psychological first aid and staff welfare programs with International NGO’s (UNOCHA, Doctors Without Borders, International Medical Corps). 

After numerous missions in conflict affected countries (Afghanistan, Burkina Faso, Myanmar) and low-income regions (Eastern Europe, Sub-Saharan Africa), he designed a 3-year complexity science, somatic and positive psychology-centred CARE training program (Clinical Abilities for Resiliency & Empowerment) and founded NeuroSystemics, a Geneva-based NGO. 

Boaz studied the effects of compassion meditation for conflict resolution at the Interdisciplinary Centre for Affective Sciences (CISA) at the University of Geneva, is currently a research lead at Life Itself Research (France) and conducts a PhD at the universities of Harvard and Zurich in implementation and community-based citizen sciences with youth. He is interested in the link between inner development and societal resilience.
