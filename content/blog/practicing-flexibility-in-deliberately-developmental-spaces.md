## About the call

Three years ago, Dr. Isabela Granic resigned her tenured professor position in developmental psychology, recognizing that her academic endeavors, aimed at enhancing the mental health and wellbeing of young individuals, primarily served to advance her own career. She observed that the science of human flourishing often remained confined within the ivory tower, failing to impact the everyday lives of the people being studied. 

Over the past year, Dr. Granic and her six co-founders have synthesized a significant portion of the research on young people's mental health, blending it with pragmatic philosophical practices from Eastern and Western traditions to create Liminal Learning. 

Liminal Learning is described as an immersive, retreat-based experience designed to facilitate purpose-driven adulthood within a collective setting. 

During the call, participants engaged in two key social practices that had proven effective in helping young individuals, based on their experiences in pilot gatherings, to cultivate trust and explore conflicts in values relevant to personal meaning and shared purpose. The outcome of the call resulted in the production of an eBook!
