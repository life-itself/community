## About the call

Three years ago I resigned my tenured professor position in developmental psychology, realizing that my life’s work in academia — meant to improve the mental health and wellbeing of young people — mostly helped build my own career. Too often the science of human flourishing remains in the ivory tower, never impacting on the everyday lives of the people we are studying. Over the last year, my 6 co-founders and I have translated much of the science on young people’s mental health and combined it with a set of pragmatic philosophical practices from Eastern and Western wisdom traditions to develop Liminal Learning. 

Liminal Learning is an embodied, retreat-based, collective launch into purpose-driven adulthood. 

In this Life Itself Community call, I will share some of the foundations of our program. We will then engage in two core social practices that have helped young people in our pilot gatherings to build trust and explore the tensions in values that feel most relevant to finding personal meaning and collective purpose.

Dr. Isabela Granic is a researcher, teacher, and designer working across sectors to help build deliberately developmental spaces and experiences that promote flourishing.

She is currently Industry Professor at McMaster University (in Canada) and the Director of the Games for Emotional and Mental Health (GEMH) lab, a large, multidisciplinary research and development lab for designing and testing digital play experiences for mental health and flourishing. She recently left full-time academia and is partnering with industry, academia, and artists to build a retreat-based creativity and contemplation program for young people’s collective launch into purpose-driven adulthood. Grounded in developmental science and ancient philosophy, she is fiercely optimistic about the future of learning and our collective potential for social, emotional, and societal wellbeing.
