We're launching a new series of community calls around the theme of conscious collectives, conscious practices and how to navigate the transition of the second renaissance. Calls will be bi-monthly usually on a Thursday evening. As well as knowledge exchange they are an opportunity for the community to connect in real time over a particular topic or discuss. 

The exact time for calls may vary depending on availability of the organizers, however calls will usually be around 1-2 hours long.

The calls vary in format but may include: 

1.  Virtual Q&A: Members of the community can ask questions and receive advice from a guest expert or panel of experts in a particular field.
    
2.  Networking event: Members can pitch their services and get feedback on their pitch. Other members can then support them in finding people to connect with their services.
    
3.  Book/article discussion: Discuss a book or article that members of the community have read prior to the call.
    
4.  Skill-building workshop: Members of the community can learn a new skill or technique related to their hobby or interest. This could include a mindfulness class, a coding class, or community living class
    
5.  Social event: Purely for socializing and getting to know other members of the community. This could include games, trivia, or other fun activities in small groups or pairs.
    
6.  Guest speaker or interview: A guest speaker or interviewee who is an expert in a particular field or has a unique perspective related to the community's interests, will share and create discussion.
    
7.  Community update or feedback session: Calls to share updates about the community's progress, goals, or initiatives, and gather feedback and suggestions from members.
