## About the call

We are multi-dimensional beings, and it therefore takes an ecology of practices to build resiliency in the face of all the different ways we suffer. In this community call we will be collectively exploring a multi-level resiliency-building approach that we practice at NeuroSystemics, a somatically and relationally-centred clinical method for trauma healing. 

n particular, we will practice some self-regulation, co-regulation and perspectival abilities that will help us be more embodied and more present in relationships. 

This call is a teaser, ahead of the up and upcoming residency Boaz is leading in June 16-30 at the Bergerac Hub, [more details here](https://neurosystemics.org/simple-event/relational-embodiment-residency/)

## About Boaz

Boaz B. Feldman (MSc, SEP, FSP, PgD) is a pragmatic visionary, clinical psychologist, trainer, researcher and contemplative acting for worldwide positive change. A depression in his early 20’s led him to ordain as a Buddhist monk in Thailand, where he practiced mindfulness meditation intensively for 3 years. He then returned to Switzerland, graduating from the University of Geneva’s Integrative Clinical Psychology Masters, and led a number of psychological first aid and staff welfare programs with International NGO’s (UNOCHA, Doctors Without Borders, International Medical Corps). 

After numerous missions in conflict affected countries (Afghanistan, Burkina Faso, Myanmar) and low-income regions (Eastern Europe, Sub-Saharan Africa), he designed a 3-year complexity science, somatic and positive psychology-centred CARE training program (Clinical Abilities for Resiliency & Empowerment) and founded NeuroSystemics, a Geneva-based NGO. 

Boaz studied the effects of compassion meditation for conflict resolution at the Interdisciplinary Centre for Affective Sciences (CISA) at the University of Geneva, is currently a research lead at Life Itself Research (France) and conducts a PhD at the universities of Harvard and Zurich in implementation and community-based citizen sciences with youth. He is interested in the link between inner development and societal resilience.
