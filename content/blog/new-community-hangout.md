**Who:** You and other amazing community members!

### How does this differ from the Community Calls? 
The Community Hangout is an informal opportunity for us to get together and have a chat. No-one is leading the dialogue or presenting as with the Community Calls. The Hangout is like gathering around the bonfire, or grabbing a coffee off the cuff. We invite you to come regularly and simply as you are. We may suggest themes or topics for each week, but really these can go in any direction we want.

Don't miss out on this exciting opportunity to connect, have fun, and be part of something special! ‚ú® 

This is a trial for a longer-term hangout, so do spread the word and invite your friends!

See you there!
