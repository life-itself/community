## The Conversation
There's a special move that we've all made, multiple times in fact: a transformation that Adult Development theorists call the "Subject-Object Shift." It's a powerful perspective expansion that can untangle our thorniest challenges and unlock great freedom and peace — and yet almost no one consciously knows how we do it! 

The underlying pattern of growing up and becoming wise typically remains unseen. Within Intentional Society, we set out to bridge that theory-and-practice gap. Now, after multiple years of hands-on developmental and relational practice work, we've distilled our "how to grow" learning into a three-word model: Awareness, Acceptance, Integrity. In this community call, James will explain the mental motions these words point to and some practices that can support us in growing bigger than our problems. Together we'll then explore where we can see these in our experiences already and how this applies to challenges in our inner lives, communities, and workplaces

## About James Baker
James is the founder of [Intentional Society](https://www.intentionalsociety.org), a diverse and distributed, online-face-to-face, metamodern, and deliberately developmental community centered around being who we want to be and doing what we value. Prior to 2020, he did a lot of frenetic growing during his software development career wherein he stumbled into complex system tending and post-conventional ways of being. Still growing (deliberately now), James enjoys spreading spaciousness, relevance realization, soulful service, and practical parenting, and co-facilitates the [Relational Agility course.](https://www.presentofwork.com/relational-agility)
