As we move into 2024, we would like to summarize and reflect on our research in 2023. We hope to provide here a sense of some of the current motivations and inspirations for Life Itself Research, and provide an understanding of what we will be focusing on as we get things going in 2024. 

### Finding our research purpose 

Our current research can be roughly summarized in the following diagram.

Like some, we believe that we are in the process of a major civilizational transition, one in which our fundamental views and values need to be reconsidered, and we hope to open up the space to explore this transition in theory and practice. These two work streams ultimately aim towards trying to better understand and embrace this transition in meaningful ways. The paradigms which have driven (post)modernity require a deep and essential mourning, and new views and values need to come into being to guide this civilizational transition. And so, we view this period as a time to  more carefully examine how we should understand the world we live in and ourselves.

## Second Renaissance 

For over two years, Life Itself [has been mapping an emerging ecosystem of change agents](https://ecosystem.lifeitself.org/), and recently, [we have been working with partners on the cohere+ project](https://lifeitself.org/blog/2023/08/30/cohere-erasmus-mapping-announce) to make use of and build on this ecosystem mapping. We are especially interested in change agents who are focused on ‘paradigmatic’ change, or systems transformation, and ‘integrated’ change, or change at multiple scales. And so, in 2024 and beyond we want to help to build and develop this network of change agents. We prefer to use the term 'Second Renaissance' to describe this ecosystem of change agents. 

Even though the cohere project is focused on ‘cohering’ this field, we would like, in 2024, to provide more materials and opportunities for people to learn more about systems transformation and get informed about this field, to support the growth of this field and movement. 
  
## Deliberately Developmental (Transformational) Spaces

Paradigmatic change requires not only ‘societal’ change, but inner change, and communities of individuals who are able to meaningfully enable these two possibilities.  During this time and as part of these two work streams, we hope to begin and develop research, opportunities, and dialogue related to this major civilization transition on these two scales. In 2023 we created our website for [Deliberately Developmental (or transformational) spaces](https://developmentalspaces.org/), which outlines some of the research from our [Deliberately Developmental Spaces project](https://lifeitself.org/blog/2021/10/05/deliberately-developmental-spaces-a-key-to-addressing-the-metacrisis). One can also find the ‘five whys’ for this kind of research, which ultimately go back to ‘ontological development’ or the cultivation of being, and on this website there is also a manifesto to sign to show your support for the movement. Although we see our role as primarily helping to develop a Second Renaissance movement, Deliberately Developmental spaces are an essential part of this movement. 
  
## Field building 

Both of our two work streams are concerned with ‘field building’, and so it has been a topic we have discussed and focused on a lot in recent months. [This blog post outlines what some of that process has looked like in the field of Deliberately Developmental Spaces](https://lifeitself.org/blog/2023/12/11/finding-the-center-blog-post). Even though Deliberately Developmental spaces are more focused on inner ontological growth, a Second Renaissance movement is not only concerned with social transformation, but on exploring and bringing into practice new ways of being and relating to the world for individuals.

In 2024, we would like to see major steps made for the Life Itself research community to be self-motivated and drive social change. Now that we have our research questions and the shaping for our year ahead, we encourage others to join our conversation and participate in building both of these fields. 

## The year of being unreasonable 

The ways of thinking and being and relating to the world which modernity largely inspires, which we are so familiar with, need to be shaken off, and within our own research collective, we have emphasized the possibility of being ‘unreasonable’. It is an important tension for us to hold: usually, when we hear the word unreasonable, we think of someone who is stubborn or incapable of compromise, and it carries a negative connotation. We would like to explore the positive connotation, or possibility, of being unreasonable: namely, that it is a time where we should be unreasonable (that being unreasonable is the ‘reasonable’ thing to do). We are at the time when we have to be asking the question:  how can we have conversations to prepare for a major civilizational transition? It might not come off as a reasonable question, but it's the question we should be asking ourselves.
