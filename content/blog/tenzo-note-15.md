**As the main food guardian of the Hub, I am thrilled to share with you our food principles. I am Valerie Duvauchelle, and I am  the designer of the Praxis food system we use at the hub.** 

In the Zen tradition, the Tenzo embodies the role of the community food spirit  and the sacred space where meals are prepared. Tenzo is also called at the hub the food guardian and is part of our stewardship together with the house guardian. Its function is to create a nurturing kitchen environment, sharing  a design to support and inspire cooks, and fostering togetherness among all participants.

At Praxis, we embrace the elegance and joy of Zen food practices. Our culinary approach is guided by three foundational principles:

- Caring for all life: Mindfully considering the well-being of plants, animals, and humans within our food system.
- Honoring humans: Supporting local organic producers and celebrating their stories to create an authentic food experience.
- Sobering all energy: Minimizing waste and reflecting on our personal needs to protect our lives and the world, with a focus on finance, ethics, and ecology.

Throughout our time together at the hub , we invite you to immerse yourself in a plant-based culinary experience that nourishes both body and soul. Our meals are carefully crafted to exclude animal products and their derivatives, enabling you to explore new flavors and embrace a satisfying satiety. This is not about following vegan dogma, but rather an opportunity to taste an alternative and, most importantly, to question our true needs. We understand that individual dietary requirements may vary, based on specific physical or emotional needs, and that's perfectly fine. Amid the complexities of our food system, the food Praxis  at our hub raises questions about the personal and the collective, rather than providing definitive answers.

To help organize, we have an additional fridge exclusively designated for storing personal food, which may include dairy, fish, cheese, or meat. We insist that these items come from the most ethical producers; this is our only requirement. During the week, the collective fridge does not contain any animal products, with the exception of butter, which we include in our breakfasts (sourced from grass-fed cows). Animal products are only permitted in the main kitchen during weekends. This approach allows us to reconnect with a sense of celebration while being aware of the cost for those animals and deeply honoring their sacrifice.

More generally, we are mindful of avoiding the purchase of industrial products that deplete aquifers by extracting excessive water, degrade land through monoculture practices such as palm oil production, and contribute to social injustice.

Our cooking time is based on a rolling system where everybody will have the opportunity to experience the privilege to nourish the community (head chef) supported by our Praxis collective Food  culinary system  and the Tenzo (food steward). 

Our hub menus are centered around three key elements: unseasoned cereals, a variety of beans (including tofu or soy proteins), and a refreshing raw salad. We can have dessert  served with dinner, and cookies are offered during lunch every other day. We use a diverse range of grains, such as buckwheat, spelt, bulgur, and millet, along with ingredients like soy sauce, tamari, tofu, and seeds. Soy is incorporated in various forms. Desserts are thoughtfully prepared without white sugar, with a focus on promoting overall well-being. Breakfast is a self-serve experience, offering oatmeal, plant-based milk, coffee, teas, and ethically sourced cow's butter. Lunches are buffet-style, allowing you the freedom to choose to eat collectively,  with one specific person or by yourself , and dinners are seated, creating a more intimate and shared atmosphere.

The cereal is typically unseasoned, and garlic or onions are not mixed in when raw. This approach allows us to embrace a different sense of nourishment derived from the natural taste of ingredients rather than relying on heavy spices. This principle may vary among chefs to allow for freedom and variety in our meals.

During the week (Monday to Friday), we request drug and alcohol not be consumed in the hub.
