## The conversation

Artists, makers, performers, and other creatives have their own needs when it comes to shared spaces. We'll talk about challenges and solutions in designing spaces that can meet and adapt to those needs. The right environment has the ability to foster creative collaboration, reduce tensions, and provide the support and flexibility freelance artists need to pursue art as a career. We'll also talk about finding emotional and operational balance between one's creative craft, and one's community.
