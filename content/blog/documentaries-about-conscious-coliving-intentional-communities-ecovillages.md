We recently shared an article [[dont-join-a-cult-documentaries-about-cults-intentional-communties|Listing several documentaries about cults gone wrong]] to demonstrate some of the red flags to look for before joining a conscious community of any sort. In this article, we want to expand and cover multiple perspectives on the exploration of conscious coliving. 

From looking at faith-based communities like Damanhur, to intentional communities built around permaculture and sustainability, such as in the documentary a Simpler Way - the aim of this list is to present opportunities for learning about the benefits, challenges and experiences of communal living.
