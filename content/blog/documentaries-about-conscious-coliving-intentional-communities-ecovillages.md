We recently shared an article [[dont-join-a-cult-documentaries-about-cults-intentional-communties|Listing several documentaries about cults gone wrong]] to demonstrate some of the red flags to look for before joining a conscious community of any sort. In this article, we want to expand and cover multiple perspectives on the exploration of conscious coliving. 

From looking at faith-based communities like Damanhur, to intentional communities built around permaculture and sustainability, such as in the documentary a Simpler Way - the aim of this list is to present opportunities for learning about the benefits, challenges and experiences of communal living.  
  
### Work in progress

>The list of documentaries, shorts, mini-series, lectures is by no means exhaustive. If you know of a visual media project that should be featured on this email [hello@lifeitself.org](mailto:hello@lifeitself.org) with your suggestions.
