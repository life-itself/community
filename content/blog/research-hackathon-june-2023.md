We are excited to announce the first **Life Itself Research Hackathon**. It will take place on Saturday 3rd June 2023 ([what's a hackathon?](#what-is-a-hackathon)). This is a chance to come together to work on projects and ideas connected with the [[../../../../research|Life Itself Research Community]].

Our focus for the hackathon is prototyping introductory reading lists, curricula and knowledge maps for the key ideas and concepts related to bringing forth a radically wiser, weller world 🌍 -- [read more below 👇](#theme-for-the-hackathon).

This is a free event open to all and you can join online -- or in person if you want to come to our [[../../../../hubs/bergerac|Bergerac Hub]]. If you're interested to participate, fill out the registration form linked below and we'll reach out with more details.

### Theme for the hackathon

Our focus for the hackathon is prototyping introductory reading lists, curricula and knowledge maps for the key ideas and concepts related to making a radically wiser, weller world 🌍.

You are welcome to join and help out with these or you can bring your own ideas for projects that are connected with any of the broader [Life Itself Research Community topics](https://lifeitself.org/research#topics).

### Reading lists and curricula

One particular idea is creating [[../../../../notes/reading-lists-hackathon-project|reading-lists-hackathon-project|simple reading lists for key ideas and background]] in our emerging field.

The goal is to help direct people towards high quality learning resources around particular topic areas. e.g. answering questions such as "How can I learn about topic X as a newcomer?" and "What are the canonical texts for topic X?".

Some inspiration for this (not in our area but showing the kind of idea):

- [Places Journal reading lists](https://placesjournal.org/reading-lists/)
- [LessWrong library](https://www.lesswrong.com/library)
- [notion reading lists](https://parameter.io/notion-reading-list-templates/)
- [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/system-design)

### Knowledge maps

The reading lists connect with a broader effort to create **high-level knowledge map**: that is interactive knowledge maps and visualization that show the key topics and themes and how they fit together. This answers questions like: "What topics should you learn about if you want to engaged with this kind of work?" and "What topics are adjacent or related to topic X e.g. inner development?"

Knowledge map inspiration:

- [UNESCO](https://ich.unesco.org/en/dive&display=constellation#tabs)

### Schedule of the day

A rough schedule for the day will look something like this (Europe/France time):

- **09:30** – Kick-off and intro
- **10:00** – Hacking
- **13:15** – Quick check-in
- **13:30** – Lunch
- **14:30** – Hacking
- **17:00** – Project presentations, feedback, Qs, discussion
- **18:00** – End

**No worries if you can only join part of the day - this is about connection and hanging out as a much as making so you are welcome to show up any time**

### Pre-days

Some of us will be coming together to work before and after both in person and online. You are welcome to join - let us know in the registration form if this is of interest.

### FAQs

#### What skills should I have to attend?

Curiosity is the only essential skill.

You do **not** need a background in research or academia.

#### What if I don't have a project?

No worries! We will have projects you can join.

#### What if I have an idea for a project that's outside of the theme?

Great! Let us know in the registration form.

#### Can I join for part of the day?

Yes! You are welcome to join for any part of the day or pre-days.

#### When are the pre-days?

If you're interested in joining for any of the pre-days, let us know in the registration form and we'll be in touch.

#### What is a hackathon?

A hackathon (also known as a hack day; a portmanteau of hacking and marathon) is an event where people engage in rapid and collaborative engineering over a relatively short period of time such as 24 or 48 hours. As this event is hosted by the Life Itself Research community we will be working on research projects that aren't exclusively confined to coding.
