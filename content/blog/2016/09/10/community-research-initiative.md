## Why do research?

- To set out “What is to be done / What is doable?”
    - What is our vision of the future that _we_ want to see — and how  
        do they fit together
    - What actions do we want take
    - Why Art / Earth / Tech
- Create policies and recommendations e.g. in governance, in politics,  
    in technology
- Answer specific questions we have - without it coming under a bigger  
    theme
- Have a shared understanding within Art / Earth / Tech
- To do collaborative research and get experience of doing them  
    without the normal incentive structures
- Answer practical questions e.g. what practical challenges are there to doing what we would like or what business model could we have?
    - This would likely come under other activities e.g. the working  
        group looking at material sustainability would research  
        business models

## Criteria

- Relate to why we do this
- Interesting to those who are going to contribute …
- Not too hard
    - Will not take years to get anywhere
        - we may do big multi-year research at some point however  
            probably would do that in its own working group
        - Will not require very deep specialist knowledge (e.g.  
            quantum physics)
- Accessible - others can join in, others outside of Art / Earth /  
    Tech could be interested
- Replicable - others can follow our findings and “repeat” them in  
    appropriate manner

## Guidelines for Primers

- What are we trying to achieve with the primer items? Ans: **Have a shared understanding within AET group and community**
    - No need for originality - we can copy and paste from wikipedia!
    - They can be opinionated
    - Establish common ground
- Audience
    - Who is going to read it? AET community and the research group.
    - What prior knowledge is expected
        - Of the broader AET research effort: non especially
        - May be useful to understand these are part of AET  
            research effort but not essential
        - Of the specific topic: can vary. Usually assume very little.  
            On technical topics is fine to state pre-requisites e.g.  
            please go and read this and this
- Length: 1-5 pages.
    - 1 page is great! 1 page exec summary if more than 2 pages.
    - \+ further reading / references
- Style: friendly, succinct, informative, not too academic.
