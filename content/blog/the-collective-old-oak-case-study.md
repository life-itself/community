The Collective represents a paradigm shift in urban living in London—a departure from traditional housing towards a model that prioritises community, sustainability, and shared values. At its core, conscious co-living is about fostering meaningful connections, embracing diversity, and creating a space where residents feel a sense of purpose and belonging. In the heart of London, where the pulse of city life beats strongly, The Collective stands as an embodiment of conscious co-living. This unique space goes beyond being a residence to create a mindful and connected community. In this blog post, we delve into the intricacies of The Collective, exploring how it exemplifies conscious co-living principles and sets a precedent for intentional communities worldwide.

**The Founding:

The Collective, stands as a unique testament to the evolution of communal living in urban spaces. Founded in 2016, this innovative co-living space emerged from the visionary minds of its founders, Reza Merchant and James Scott. Their mission was to address the changing landscape of urban life, recognising the need for affordable, flexible, and community-driven housing solutions.  Reza Merchant, a young entrepreneur, brought his passion for disrupting traditional real estate models to the project. Alongside him, James Scott, with a background in real estate and sustainability, played a pivotal role in shaping The Collective into a unique living experience. The founders envisioned a space where residents seamlessly blend private and communal living, challenging the isolation often associated with conventional urban dwellings. This vision laid the groundwork for a community-driven environment that values diversity, collaboration, and shared experiences.

**The Design:

The physical design of The Collective is meticulously crafted to promote conscious interactions. Communal spaces are strategically placed, encouraging spontaneous encounters and fostering a sense of community. Shared kitchens, collaborative workspaces, and communal areas become the canvas upon which residents paint their shared experiences. The Collective’s design prioritises functional layouts and versatile spaces, incorporating sliding doors and adaptable furniture that transform living areas based on residents' dynamic needs. This commitment to flexibility underscores the importance of responsive design in promoting practical living within a communal setting. The intentional use of space optimisation through multi-functional furniture maximises living spaces and enhances adaptability and order, positively influencing residents' daily lives.

**Environmental Action:

Conscious co-living extends beyond social connections to environmental stewardship, and The Collective embraces this wholeheartedly. A  sustainability tour led by Jon Forrester, Head of Hard Service Facilities Management, showcased the community's commitment to optimising inputs and outputs, thus having a positive impact on its members and the surrounding environment. 

**Their initiatives included:

- A plant room which is certified BREEAM 'Excellent' which operates with a combined heat and power system
    
- A water purifier with an ioniser coil, ensuring the efficient and healthy water utilisation 
    
- Reusing 'wasted' energy to achieve an impressive 80% energy efficiency
    
- Significantly reducing fossil fuel consumption
    
- The roof features air handling unit exchangers, a 'Brown Roof' with greenery retaining 82% of rainfall
    
- 52 solar panels generating 25kw per year
    
- Recycled plastic floors and sustainably sourced timber kitchen cupboards 
    

**Community Activity:

Another focal point of The Collective's is its lively calendar of events that transcends conventional social gatherings. From workshops and cultural exchanges to mindfulness sessions, these activities are deeply ingrained in the fabric of community life. Residents actively participate, sharing their talents, learning from one another, and collectively enhancing the cultural tapestry of the community. With a diverse range of events, including morning yoga, mindfulness talks, movie marathons, and ping-pong tournaments, there's something for everyone. Such activities play a pivotal role in cultivating friendships and nurturing a robust, thriving community within the co-living space.


In the vibrant landscape of urban living, The Collective stands as a testament to the evolving narrative of community living in London. Infused with visionary principles, architecturally dynamic spaces, and a vibrant sense of community, this co-living space embodies the essence of modern, connected living. Navigating through the communal corridors of The Collective reveals more than just a residence; it unveils a living testament to the transformative power of intentional community design, where people come together to forge connections, share experiences, and embrace a lifestyle that goes beyond mere habitation.
