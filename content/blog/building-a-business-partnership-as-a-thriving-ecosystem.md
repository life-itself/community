## The Conversation

• Define an ideal business partner and dissect the intricacies of a partnership that did not work.<br/>
• Discuss how they turned these lessons into a distinctive approach for initiating a business partnership, instrumental to their short- and long-term success. <br/>
• Share specific issues around sharing power, and opportunities to deepen your capacity to share power and empower others in business. <br/>
• Detail how they operate WINC not just as a business, but as an ecosystem, where everyone gets to thrive inside the company and out. <br/>
• Discuss the one thing Elizabeth and Myka do that is extremely rare, but makes their decision-making around delicate financial issues create more trust and less friction, instead of tearing their relationship and business apart. <br/>
• And how they have expanded their view of business partnership as a much bigger vision and support system than just running one company together. <br/>
