## The Conversation

The conversation covers the essential aspects of a business partnership. They start by defining an ideal business partner and breaking down the intricacies of  previous partnership that didn't succeed. They then elaborate on how these lessons were translated into a distinctive approach, crucial for both short- and long-term success. There is a focus on sharing power, with opportunities highlighted to deepen their capacity for empowerment within the business realm. They detail how they operate WINC not merely as a business but as an ecosystem, fostering thriving both inside and outside the company. They touch upon a unique aspect: what they do, which is exceptionally rare yet builds trust and reduces friction in handling delicate financial issues, avoiding strain on their relationship and business. Finally, they expand their view of business partnership as a more extensive vision and support system beyond the operation of a single company together.
