Elizabeth Winheld and Myka McLaughlin, founders of [Women In Community](https://womenincommunity.com/) and business partners for the last seven years have taught over 15,000 entrepreneurs globally, imparting wisdom on building profitable businesses that transform lives, families, and communities.

In this community call you’ll learn an embodied perspective from them about why their partnership has been seamless. No drama. No legal battles. No daily friction. Easy Decision making. Greater trust over time, not less.  

Having learned how to create their company and partnership like a thriving community and ecosystem Elizabeth and Myka will:

• Define an ideal business partner and dissect the intricacies of a partnership that did not work.</br>
• Discuss how they turned these lessons into a distinctive approach for initiating a business partnership, instrumental to their short- and long-term success.</br>
• Share specific issues around sharing power, and opportunities to deepen your capacity to share power and empower others in business.</br>
• Detail how they operate WINC not just as a business, but as an ecosystem, where everyone gets to thrive inside the company and out.</br>
• Discuss the one thing Elizabeth and Myka do that is extremely rare, but makes their decision-making around delicate financial issues create more trust and less friction, instead of tearing their relationship and business apart.</br> 
• And how they have expanded their view of business partnership as a much bigger vision and support system than just running one company together.</br>
