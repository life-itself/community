>*These weekly sessions helped to awaken my imagination in work and everyday life, and to deepen my connection with creative parts of myself that have been dormant.*

### Why does art and creativity matter? 

**Well it is your expression, the one which is unique to you.** 
It is a way of making sense of the world and your life, to integrate different parts of yourself and express them. Our Morning Creative Practice calls are here so we can make time to develop our artistic side and explore the depth of our humanity.

### What will I get out of the call?

ðŸ’ª Creativity is like a muscle, the more you practice the stronger it gets.<br/>
ðŸ¦š You get to be more intune with yourself and your intuition.<br/>
ðŸŽ¨ You will be part of a Whatsapp group in which you will get to share your art practice. Our community provides support and helps you with motivation, since one of the hardest things is to keep yourself motivated in your creative practice when you are alone.<br/>
ðŸŒ… Morning is the best time to activate your right brain, so you will continue your day being more in the flow.<br/>

### Here are some of the practices we will do:

ðŸŒŸ Collages<br/>
ðŸŒŸ Spontaneous Writing<br/>
ðŸŒŸCreative Contemplation<br/>
ðŸŒŸ Ritual<br/>
ðŸŒŸ Navigating Mythologies<br/>

### Who is it for?

Our Morning Creative Practice Calls are for anyone who wants to develop a practice to unleash their creative side and authentically connect with like minded people. If you feel the call, we encourage you to follow it and join us!

âœ¨You want to develop spiritually but silent meditation is not your thing.<br/>
âœ¨You already make art but miss having a community with whom you can authentically share.<br/>
âœ¨Getting out of bed in the morning does not come naturally and having an external commitment really helps.<br/>
âœ¨For you art is spiritual but you are caught in making art for commercial purposes.<br/>
âœ¨You are someone who gets insight from taking actions.<br/>


>*I would highly recommend these calls for those who are looking for ways to express themselves, creative motivation and connection with others*

### The creative culture of Life ItselfÂ

Here at Life Itself we value Art, as we see it as a profound expression of our humanity and access to our sense of oneness. Our creativity is an access to sense making into the second Renaissance. The call will be led by Sylvie Barbier, performance artist and co-founder of Life Itself.

>*My mind, body and soul were nourished by the creative practices Sylvie offered as well as the group sharing their work and a part of themselves.*
