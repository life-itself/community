The Bergerac Praxis Hub is a space where individuals can come together to explore, practice, and embody new ways of being and relating to each other and the world. We see this space as a place for experimentation, exploration, and learning, where people can engage in self-work, creative work, and spiritual practices within a supportive and structured framework. We believe that this framework, which combines elements of monastic and secular practices, can facilitate the development of a new paradigm of living and being, one that is more connected, embodied, and expansive.

We are running and hosting a series of [residencies and retreats](https://lifeitself.org/programs) that are a spiritual cooking together of various ingredients: people, practices, workshops, art, community life and actual cooking. The residences open a space, a vacuum filled by people and practices too spiritual for politics, too “political” for the monasteries, where we sit with our trouble without giving into the narrowing impulse to “save the world”. 

Residencies combine both an activating frame of collective practices (sitting meditation, cooking, cleaning and circling) with the space for you to continue your daily work – a key aspect is learning how we can integrate community and practice, collective and private, absolute and relative in our daily life.

## Key info

* **What do we do at the Praxis hub?** We run and host [residencies and retreats](https://lifeitself.org/programs). Each residency is oriented around a key theme or question.
* **How do we do it?** We propose a Praxis ecology that provides a frame combining a regenerative engagement for the collective and the space for you to continue your daily work. A key aspect is learning how we can integrate daily practices (sitting, cooking, cleaning, connecting) as an activation rather than an obligation (a service you give to your Self). 
* **Where is it?** The [Life Itself Praxis Hub](https://lifeitself.org/hubs/bergerac), Bergerac, France (South West, in the Bordeaux wine region, 20 min from the Plum Village Buddhist monastery)
* **For whom is it?** To all who wish to engage in practices: system-thinkers, researchers, spiritual ecologists, bodhisattvas, change makers, symbiotic entrepreneurs, poets, painters, eco-dharmists, people ready to just be with what comes, good and bad. 
* **How can I participate?** Apply online to one of our residencies using [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdiykDKyZR6DgtPKeYuNePy9sWc-qkIc4BVfKBRjkFWKvFp-g/viewform).
* **How much does it cost?** A typical room costs between €650 (basic room) and €1,050 (premium double room) per month / per person. In addition, the daily food costs are 18 euros per person, with a unique Zen food experience prepared by our in-house Tenzo (head cook). More information on rooms can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PBijDdlRAECvE19Nxo1fOEcq2foGJVeERZVxzIs6b9U/edit?usp=sharing). Facilitation fees may apply for the residencies. Some rooms can be shared at a reduced rate.

## About the Praxis Hub

Located just a few steps from the river and a serene park, this space is a one-of-a-kind setting comprising three small buildings. An old French palazzo, where traces of the past engage us in a heteroclite manner, adds to the unique atmosphere. It is the perfect place for deep exploration amidst its atmospheric surroundings.

### The Praxis food 

At the hub, we take great pride in our thoughtful relationship with food. This isn't simply about what we eat, but how we engage with our meals, creating a nourishing atmosphere that combines quiet reflection, gratitude, and careful consideration alongside our delectable plant-based fare.

Our food practices are firmly grounded in three fundamental principles:

* Caring - for all beings and ecosystems
* Degrowing - energy, money and time
* Honoring - human dignity

These principles allow us to strike an optimal balance between the ethical, financial, and ecological facets of our food system. The menus we curate, inspired by the Zen temple tradition, establish a mindful ambiance for the group's sustenance.

Our essential meal system is founded on a tripartite scheme, comprising:

* Cereals (100g per person, per day)
* Beans + Cooked Veggies (100g + 360g per person, per day)
* Raw Veggies (220g per person, per day)
* We also provide desserts or cookies, along with cereals and seeds for breakfast (200g per person, per day).

Our food purchases are made at the fresh market and the local organic cooperative, and we make a dedicated effort to use local and endemic ingredients as much as possible.

Collective meals are always plant-based, and we conscientiously avoid non-ethical, industrially produced food. We believe this diet provides sufficient protein for daily needs, but we encourage you to assess and cater to your personal nutritional requirements. For your convenience, we provide two additional refrigerators for personal use.

We acknowledge that plant-based food may not meet the daily B12 requirements, so for those staying longer than two weeks, we encourage supplementing this nutrient. In our endeavor to minimize our role in animal suffering, we encourage the use of any supplements involving animal products (such as B12 or protein) to be sourced solely from ethical local providers who are present at the market.

Furthermore, to promote a healthy lifestyle, we maintain an alcohol-free environment from Monday to Friday. That being said, we cherish the joy of celebration and dance, and so, good wine is welcomed at the Hub on weekends.

**Finally, we warmly welcome individuals who are interested in embracing the role of a tenzo, a reactualized version of the Zen temple cook for modern times, to join us at the residence.** It is an opportunity to engage in the art of cooking, harmonizing traditional wisdom with contemporary practices, as we prepare plant-based meals together. Come and immerse yourself in this transformative experience that combines the essence of Zen teachings with the joys of culinary exploration. **If interested, please contact our [Tenzo Valerie Duvauchelle](valerie@lifeitself.org).**


### The Praxis Lab 

The Bergerac Hub is a unique junction for people to explore innovative ways of relating to one another and the world. It's an experimental ground for self-growth, creativity, and spiritual endeavors within a nurturing structure, blending monastic and secular elements. This structure assists in cultivating a more connected and expansive lifestyle, establishing a fresh paradigm of existence.

The Hub, envisioned as a laboratory for systemic transformation, is an incubator for metamodern living—based on interdependence, mindfulness, and compassion. It's a setting where we analyze the impact of our practices on individual and communal well-being and investigate their potential for societal transformation. Practices already hosted include meditation, contemplative walks, Nordic singing, resonance singing, jam labs, forums, deep democracy, sharing circles, world cafes, enlightenment intensive, multiplayer metta meditation, zen food retreat, philosophical fellowship, and emergent dialogues.

The Praxis Lab within the Hub plays a pivotal role in data collection and research, exploring the relationships between spaces, structures, food, and practices. Its purpose is to decipher the emotional, spiritual, and intellectual effects of these elements and the actions they inspire. Our research aims to understand and define the inter-relational human technology that fuels a new way of interacting with the world. Our focus is to document these practices, exploring questions such as: what triggers action beyond thinking, what internal shifts are activated by this, and what are the impacts of this approach? An additional aspect of exploration is the concept of a space as a practice place (dojo) and how to reproducibly document self-research.

#### By train 🚆

Bergerac has a train station. We're a 20 minute walk from it through the heart of the beautiful medieval part of the town.

There is free parking right in front of the hub at Place Barbacane and alongside the riverside next to the house.

🚩 If you park in Place Barbacane you need to move your car on Thursday nights (by ~11pm) until Friday afternoon because of the market that takes place on Place Barbacane.

Alternative free parking can be found in the riverside and the public parking lot named  “Jean Barthé” (Google Maps), 3 min. walk from the hub.
