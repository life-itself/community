## More than just living

The Life Itself Hubs are where we put our beliefs and theories into practice. They're intentional communities dedicated to becoming wiser, living better, and taking pragmatic steps to solve the most pressing problems of the 21st Century. 

## Community is real

Our society may have forgotten the importance of community, but we haven’t. Sharing practices, food, learning and laughter means that the very act of living is itself transformed into a shared enterprise. Our Hubs embody what community truly means, and show the world just how valuable it can be.
