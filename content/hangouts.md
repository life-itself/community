## **About Community Hangouts**

Systems, culture and community. We all sense that we need new structures and new being for this time of transition.

Our community hangouts are a place to share and reflect on the work you’re doing and to connect with others working on similar projects from around the world.

Each hangout usually has a special guest or two to share their work and experience.

- Short welcome and getting to know each other
- Dialogue with our guest
- Open space for sharing projects, ideas and support

Participants are welcome to join for as little or as much of the hour as they would like.
