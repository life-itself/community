We are excited to be broadening the scope of the Life Itself podcast to encompass the full spectrum of work Life Itself is involved with. In this episode, Life Itself team members Theo Cox and Eilidh Ross introduce this new era, discussing how our web3 project fits in with the wider social transformation work Life Itself engages with. Theo also introduces the newest branch of Life Itself, Life Itself Labs, discussing what Labs has already been up to and his aspirations for the future of the project.
