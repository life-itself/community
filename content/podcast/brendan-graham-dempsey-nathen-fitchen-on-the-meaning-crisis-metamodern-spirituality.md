In the fourth episode of our Exploring Social Transformation series, [Nathen Fitchen](http://www.nathenfitchen.com) and [Brendan Graham Dempsey](https://www.brendangrahamdempsey.com/) discuss the rise of the meaning crisis, how it has perpetuated throughout the world and its symbiotic nature to the environmental crisis and other crises we face today.

## The Conversation

Nathen and Brendan unpack a potential antidote to the meaning crisis, metamodern spirituality. Through identifying the core characteristics of metamodern thinking and how one might engage in metamodern spirituality, this conversation is a perfect place to orient oneself with the metamodern ideology and to be inspired to find greater meaning individually and as a collective.
