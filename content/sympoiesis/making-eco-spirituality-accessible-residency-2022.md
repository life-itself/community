## Overview

This residency will explore what an engaged and accessible form of ecological spirituality might look like, how we can live with it openly, and the role it might play in a broader climate movement. It is part of Life Itself's Sympoiesis series, which are meant to allow people to pursue a work life while spending time in a community of like minded people concerned with a specific question. Our convener is Rupert Read, a former spokesperson of both Extinction Rebellion and the UK Green Party, and Professor of Philosophy at East Anglia University. Rupert's [recent work](https://systems-souls-society.com/what-next-on-climate-the-need-for-a-moderate-flank/) has been focused on organising a moderate, inclusive flank of the climate movement.

An effective climate movement may require (and certainly would be helped by) a greater spiritual connection with our planet and its sacredness to us, as well as deeper realisation of our interdependent relationship with nature. The question is ─ how can we foster an eco-spirituality, in our personal lives, and public life, that is compatible with a broad based climate movement?

True eco-spirituality cannot be a hoop that people need to jump through, a jargon or a club. It must be a welcoming way to live in the paradigm-shift and system-shift that is desperately needed.

When we truly accept the present moment in its totality, on the macro as well as the micro level, then we take entirely seriously our yearning for something more beautiful and loving, and our commitment to making it happen. One can accept the present moment globally only by embracing our natural emotions and intentions that imply world-wide change. Real acceptance of life does not mean running away, but _profoundly engaging_ with it ─ as it is.

## Residency Structure

The residency will be structured around regular daily practices focusing on nature connection, and weekly workshops/seminars focusing on the development of an accessible eco-spirituality.

The exact structure is left deliberately somewhat open in order to adapt to need once the residency commences, but some of the core elements will include:

\> _Daily practices_: time outside, walking meditation, and land-connective practices. Working in groups to maintain the space and cook. These will typically be in the morning between 10.30 and 12, but sometimes we might vary this depending on weather (though typically we will seek to be all-weather, accepting all its bounties and trials!

\> _Weekly ‘seminar'_ on building a ‘moderate flank’ in climate activism, with special reference to the importance of it being inclusive - including _spiritually_ inclusive (ecumenical, aiming at a ‘highest common factor’ among spiritualities and religions); and including _by way of_ ‘\[dark?\] green religion’ wherever it can be found.

\> _Weekly morning ‘workshop'_ on practices for cultivating good ancestry and future-visioning. Practices drawn from Rupert's book ‘[Parents for a future](http://parentsforafuture.org)’ and from his teacher Joanna Macy’s ‘Work That Reconnects’. \[This replaces the time outside, on the day it falls.\]
