# Awakening Society

An awakening society is a society oriented to "awakening": personal and collective development towards greater peace, freedom, insight and wisdom. 

Development is "multi-dimensional" incorporating (at least) cognitive, emotional, spiritual, worldview and interpersonal aspects -- or, in the phrase popular in the Integral community including waking up, growing up, cleaning up, showing up (spiritual growth, worldview evolution, therapeutic healing and service).

Put crudely, an awakening society is an **inner** growth society. This contrasts with (most) of today's society which are essentially **outer** growth societies.

Thus, the transition to an awakening society can be most simply described as a move from a focus on **outer growth** to **inner growth**.

>[!note] Inner development and cultural evolution
> Collective development could be termed "cultural evolution" and personal development also known as inner development. Thus, an awakening society is one oriented to inner development and cultural evolution.

It is important to emphasize the integral aspect of an awakening society. Thus, whilst the inner aspects of development are emphasized, at least in contrast to many of today's societies, both inner and outer development are valued.[^1]

[^1]: "Outer development" need not mean economic growth in the traditional sense. Rather, it means developments in the "outer" (right) quadrants, for example in scientific or technological capacities or in the quality and complexity or social and physical ecosystems.

## On the Term Development

Following Wilber and DiPerna, we use the term "development" broadly and interchangeably with the term "transformation". It refer to our innate human capacity to both grow (and heal) through predicable, sequential patterns of mental, emotional, and spiritual unfolding.
