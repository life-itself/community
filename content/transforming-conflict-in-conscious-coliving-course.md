### This is for you if you want to become better at dealing with conflict in your coliving situation and in life generally

⭐️ If you are already completed [[conscious-coliving-course|our Conscious Coliving 101 course]]<br/>
⭐️ If you are already in or going in to a coliving situation<br/>
⭐️ If you are currently in a period of conflict within a coliving situation<br/>
⭐️ If you have experienced conflict in the past in regards to coliving and want to navigate future conflicts better

### You will:

🔥 Understand that healthy conflict is normal and needed<br/>
🔥 Discover the usefulness of healthy conflict within relationships and communities<br/>
🔥 Understand the work you need to do to reduce the amount of conflict arising<br/>
🔥 Feel confident in resolving conflict effectively and gain practical techniques for conflict resolution.

## Here is a brief overview of what is included in each day:

**Day 1:** We examine what conflict is and why it arises. We’ll introduce you to the conflict within community and set the scene for the following days.

**Day 2:** We dive in to myth busting. We take the assumptions and pull them apart so you can approach conflict from a more neutral and grounded perspective.

**Day 3:**  We examine the greatest causes of conflict within community, why they occur and some insight into tips on how to approach them.

**Day 4:**  We tell you how to avoid conflict before it even happens and share tools and techniques which reduce the levels of conflict in a coliving environment.

**Day 5:**  We explore the self work, and characteristics needed to navigate situations of conflict. We’ll include tips and suggestions on how to enhance these characteristics to make sure you aren’t the sociopath in the group!

**Day 6:** We dive into conflict resolution processes. We outline key ones that we would recommend and talk you through them.

**Day 7:** On our final day, we tie it all together, and review what we’ve learnt from over the past 6 days, and where to go from here.
