Conscious Coliving is an overarching theme and title for our ongoing initiative which aims to provide a series of pathways to people to learn about and practice conscious coliving. 

Our initial offering is a free introductory email course - [[conscious-coliving-course|Conscious Coliving 101]] - please sign up and join us on the journey to create more connected communal spaces. 
## Motivation

At the core of Life Itself's Theory of Change, is that for us to step into the new paradigm we must create seeds for the [[the-second-renaissance-sylvie-barbier.png|Second Renaissance]]. These seeds are cultivated from physical spaces where people can connect deeply and innovate social, spiritual and practical elements for the next paradigm. 

Alongside our [[content/hubs|hubs]], the physical spaces we offer for people to learn and practice living in community, we recognise a need for an online platform for people to learn and share experiences about conscious coliving which they can then take into their own communities.
