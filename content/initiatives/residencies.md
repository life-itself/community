## Description

Life Itself is gathering groups and communities interested in radically committing, together, to be in kinship with our troubled world. We will respond to chaos together, with artistic and spiritual practice that includes deep attention to humble activities like breathing, cleaning and food. 

Under the banner of **[Sympoiesis](https://lifeitself.org/sympoiesis#sympoiesis-making-together)**, we are running a **series of residencies and retreats** that are a spiritual cooking-together of various ingredients: people, practices, workshops, art, community life and actual cooking. The ingredients are drawn by the opening of a space, a vacuum to be filled by **people and practices too spiritual for politics, too “political” for the monasteries**. The idea that life can be divorced from spirit is at the heart of our trouble. Let’s sit with this great trouble without giving into the narrowing impulse to “save the world.”

**Residencies combine both an activating frame of collective practices with the space for you to continue your daily work** – a key aspect is learning how we can integrate community and practice, collective and private, absolute and relative in our daily life.
