A residency is a place where we learn to live well and wisely with ourselves, others and in the world. We practice with our inner and relational reactivity so that we can learn to respond appropriately instead. We get to cook, work and play with a diverse group of people coming from many countries. We will be practicing all sorts of awareness practies (mindfulness, compassion, movement, art, diary), engage in small-group circles where we focus on the way in which our present moment embodied experience is affected by the speech and presence of others, and community sessions where we explore emergent questions about our society, its greatness and the urgent challenges to address change. We will create as safe a container as possible to enable the emergence of embodied regulation, relational insights and embody an ambitious relationship to the world.

We emphasise learning & integrating: we will have propose several ways to learn the art and science of developing inner and relational resiliency through workshops and didactic sessions.  The immersion format allows for insights from structured experiential sessions to be integrated in relationships during the residency itself. The online sessions before and after we meet in Bergerac (France) allow for integration into one’s work, family and daily life because we want this process to impact your life in the long term!

“It was amazing. In many ways, very joyful, very playful, meaningful interactions, whether it was in groups or dyads”
– Camille M., Researcher, 2023 Residency Participant in Bergerac

Why Be More Relationally Embodied?

The quality of our relationships has recently shown to be the important factor for mental health. In school we did not learn how to build strong relationships, how to repair a connection when a rupture occurred, or how to express our needs for safety and emotional support. This residency aims to strengthen our way of engaging in relationships so that we can feel freer to be ourselves with others, and build strong bonds.

Regulate: We will learn to self-regulate &  co-regulate, which means we learn to support one another to feel better together. We learn to feel better somatically (in our body), emotionally (feeling well-being) and socially (feeling more embedded with others). We embody a responsive, not reactive, connexion to ourselves and others.
Restore: From this sense of connection, safety and confidence, our patterns of dysregulation and dissociation (related to previous traumas) can soften and be released.
Respond: As we grow our nervous system capacity and relational skills, we have more space, agency and possibility for new ways of engaging with the world.
The conceptual framework for group sessions stems of psychodynamic and attachment theories as well as systems, somatic, social and positive psychology to support relational resiliency. We emphasize “neuroceptive safety” which means we specifically attempt to modulate the containment of the group to skilfully face the challenges emerging, and embody the resources developed. For example, we start with a short embodiment practice at the beginning of the session to prime for somatic sensitivity and speaking from a place of experience. As the group builds in its quality of compassion, mutual support and enjoyment, it become a womb-like experience which enables a deep nervous system regulation for the group as a whole. Joining us in this residency, you benefit by:

Sensing and caring for the different states of your nervous system (self-regulation)
Find out how you are impacted by others in an embodied way (co-regulation), and liberate yourself from constricting relational habits
Being able to express yourself more authentically with others (perspective-taking), understand and appreciate others’ point of view (empathy)
Learning the basic processes of creating safe-group spaces and group interventions (facilitation)
Inquiring skilfully, in an embodied way, into difficult questions we are facing today as a society and as a species
