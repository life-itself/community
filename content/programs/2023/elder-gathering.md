This August, the Praxis Hub of Life Itself, Bergerac, France, will serve as the exciting stage for a **multi-week event steeped in wisdom, connectivity, and practice.**

We commence our journey from August 7th to 12th with the **Respond Practitioner Retreat**. For a fee of €2,000, you'll engage in online training, housing, meals, and hands-on training sessions. We're committed to making this transformative experience accessible to all, offering support resources for those who may need help with funding.

In the Respond Practitioner Retreat, you'll delve into Respond's theories and methods, apply 'A Theory of Wisdom' to your own practices, and learn to construct an Ecology of Practices with the help of the DIME method for wisdom training.

Following this initial retreat, we'll transition into a remarkable **gathering featuring renowned figures such as Nora Bateson and John Vervaeke**. This will be an opportunity to connect, learn, and share experiences with thought-leaders in various fields.

The event culminates with **two weeks of retreat**, where attendees will have the opportunity to consolidate their learning, deepen their practice, and foster connections within the network.

Join us for this exhilarating blend of wisdom, practice, and community-building at the Praxis Hub. Let's grow together!

### The Praxis Hub

The Bergerac Praxis Hub is gathering groups and communities interested in radically committing, together, to be in kinship with the world as it is. We will respond to uncertainty together, with collective embodied practices that include deep attention to humble activities like breathing, creating living space, or preparing food together. 

Beyond the seemingly paradoxical nature of contemplative activism, we carry the intention of the ungraspable concept of a metamodern monastery.

_Our vision is to create a space where individuals can come together to explore, practice, and embody new ways of being and relating to each other and the world._

### The Praxis Lab 

The  Praxis Lab is an evolutionary research space within the Praxis Hub aiming to define and document through scientific observations the ecologies of practices that foster a disposition of engaging differently in the world.

In particular through collecting data and studying the interrelations between spaces, structures and practices, it aims to make visible how the interplay/relational  identity between individuals and their environment (space, structure, practices) shapes their emotional, spiritual and intellectual disposition.
