This Residency is both a practical and embodied experience incorporating the basics of the benevolent kitchen that Valerie 
has actualised from the zen food temple practice and bridged it with permaculture, deep ecology, collective embodiment and 
food community organization to answer accordingly the questions of our time. 

## Context

Food is life in action, a circular process that allows us to receive as well as give. It is the most direct experience we can have with the world. When we eat, we literally eat the world, the earth, but we also eat what this earth is made of - its mycelium, the agreements found by the hundreds of cooks before us. It is also the whole history of our food that is tasted with each bite, the history of all the relationships it has woven between the land, the people, the animals, and the landscapes.

Cooking and eating are much more profound than we imagine, and today, perhaps more than ever in the history of humanity, they offer us the opportunity to remember and recognize that each meal is what binds us together, our depressed identity which bears the imprint of the past, while at the same time marking the future.

The transformation of the world depends on the way we look at it, and this can be activated by communion with our food. This can only be done through joy, not dogma. It is an activism of contemplation as powerful as militant activism. It is because we eat every day that we live. To reconnect with this reality is to reconnect with the joy of the community of the living which reactivated us, and we can easily spread this way of practicing food like a virus, just by cooking for people around us.

## Program 
During this residency you will experience a broader food territory and develop your capacity to contribute better to a new way of living, cooking food that matters in times of trouble.

## The Bergerac hub: a  space to explore community of practices

The Bergerac Hub is interested in the balance between collective sharing of community care and individual space. Exploring one's personal needs in light of those of the collective is finding the fluctuating middle ground between private and collective, solitary and group activities is the funambulist proposition we explore at the Praxis hub in Bergerac. For this we propose a dynamic framework of Praxis ecology with a structure based on 4 main practices ( sitting , cooking, cleaning and regulating) in which each group can evolve according to its proclivities.

## Testimonials

### Catherine Sengthavy, Kinésithérapeute, Shiatsu 

>The training proposed by Valerie Duvauchelle is unique and original,The strength of this teaching is to realize that questions that could be considered purely practical (how to compose a menu, what quantity, what ingredient to have) stem from a deeper personal reflection. The experience makes it possible to no longer distinguish the limits of what I think I am, the other, the others, the near and the far.

### Ona Maioco, Vegan Chef

>My encounter with Valérie has profoundly transformed my relationship with cooking. As a fan of "flashy" seasonings, I was able to discover another way of cooking allowing listening before any "voluntarist" intervention, erasing the ego and inviting us to a new dance. It's a priceless gift in these troubled times to put cooking back at the heart of our lives and communities, the indispensable engine of our joyful sustenance…and I am so grateful.

### Sandra Dao, retreat Participant, facilitator and owner of La Source

>One of the first things that touched me was the fluidity and simplicity with which everything was organized in the kitchen, in a true collaboration. Valerie was able to quickly establish a trust and sharing that was precious to me, and calling upon our own creativity.. There is something life changing about this teaching.

### Tiernan Banks, poet and leader of Death Crash

>This experience has led me to reflect on: the seeming benefits/importance of (measured) hunger; the importance of variety; the importance of raw foods and balanced flavours. What has been most striking has not just been the physical benefits from this, but the meditative / calming aspects too. It is very rare that a lunch/dinner will inspire this level of reflection in me, and so that in itself speaks volumes!
