In this long-term residency, participants will engage in a variety of Minimum Viable Practices (MVPs): shared cooking, silent sitting, house and garden care. Optionally there are a variety of other practices e.g. circling, systemic constellations, zen etc. that will be co-designed and co-facilitated by the group. These activities also nourish the living laboratory spirit of the hub, which aims to explore the intersection of individuality and community, to challenge traditional perspectives, and cultivate a compassionate, cooperative ethos.

This long-term residency allows the space for each to do their own remote work within a lightweight developmental "frame". A lot of us who are already here are using these months to focus on creative work, such as writing a book, painting, or designing courses.

It is open to all system-thinkers, researchers, spiritual ecologists, bodhisattvas, change makers, symbiotic entrepreneurs, poets, painters, eco-dharmists - any people ready to just be with what comes and welcome dancing within complexity.


Building upon a previous season of sympoesis residencies, where themes like contemplative activism, eco-spirituality, interbeing, collective intelligence, and relational embodiment were explored, the practices we engage in are designed to inspire a compassionate lifestyle, ecological balance, and a shift from individual isolation to a sense of supportive community. 

Regarding food, our house Tenzo, Valerie, will guide the group through daily cooking practices as part of the deliberately developmental technologies of the hub. 


Schedule (indicative and will change with the needs of the participants):

- 7-8 am: just sitting in Dojo 
- 8-9 am: optional breakfast 
- 9-10 am: collective care for cooking, cleaning, gardening
- 10 am-1 pm: own time
- 1-2 pm: buffet lunch and dishes
- 2-6:30pm: own time
- 6:30-7:30 pm: table dinner and dishes
- 8pm: optional evening activity 

Besides the daily structure, there can be a weekly sharing/regulatory circle. In addition, participants may offer their own sessions to other residents.

Weekends don't have any frame. During that time spontanous cooking and eating organisation happens. This is a time that gives opportunity to discover surroundings such as Plum Village or prehistorical caves. 

The monthly cost  ranges between 300 to 850 euros depending on the room, plus approx. 300 euros for food and amenities. All communal food is organic and plant-based.

Ideal candidates are those who resonate with these principles and practices and are ready to explore their impact on a personal and communal level.
