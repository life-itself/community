The Bergerac Praxis Hub is launching a pioneering residency program that offers a way of living based on an  ecology of practices to establish a team of dedicated residents for a 3 to 6-month term. It is open to all who wish to engage in practices: 
system-thinkers, researchers, spiritual ecologists, bodhisattvas, change makers, symbiotic entrepreneurs, poets, 
painters, eco-dharmists, people ready to just be with what comes, good and bad.

In this unique proposition, residents will engage in a variety of Minimum Viable Practices (MVPs) such as shared cooking, silent sitting, house care, circling, and gardening. These activities serve as a living laboratory to explore the intersection of individuality and community, challenging traditional perspectives, and cultivating a compassionate, 
cooperative ethos.

Beyond providing an unconventional living arrangement, the Bergerac Praxis Hub immerses residents 
in a vibrant community committed to the research and development of innovative practices that our research team documents all year long.  
Building upon a previous season of sympoesis residencies, where themes like contemplative activism, 
eco-spirituality, interbeing, collective intelligence, and relational embodiment were explored, these 
practices are designed to inspire a compassionate lifestyle, ecological balance, and a shift from individual 
isolation to a sense of supportive community. 

Regarding food, our house Tenzo, Valerie, will guide them through daily cooking practices rooted in the Zen 
tradition. With a century-long legacy of conscious food practice, Valerie will share her expertise and adapt 
these timeless wisdom to our modern times. This presence brings an additional layer of knowledge transmission.

Besides the daily structure, there will be once a week a regulatory circle and twice a week emergent offering sessions by residents. 
Week ends don't have any frame. During that time spontanous cooking and eating organisation happens. This is a time that gives opportunity to discover surroundings such as Plum Village or prehistorical caves. 


For a monthly cost between 850 to 1250 euros (organic plant based food included),  
residents will be able to experience an inspiring  way of living together.Participants  are also welcome to share their unique skills, knowledge and other resources with the rest of the community. 

Ideal candidates are those who resonate with these principles and practices and are ready to explore their impact on a 
personal and communal level. In other words people who feel called by the secular monk posture. Interested individuals are encouraged to apply by september 30th, 2023, to join this 
venture that emphasizes the deep ontological effects  of living together within a structure.
