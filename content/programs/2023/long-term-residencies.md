The Bergerac Praxis Hub is launching a pioneering residency program that offers a transformative 
and supportive environment for individuals ready to deeply commit to a metamodern lifestyle. 
Positioned as a beacon of metamodern thought and ecology of practices, the Hub aims to establish 
a team of dedicated residents for a 3 to 6-month term. It is open to all who wish to engage in practices: 
system-thinkers, researchers, spiritual ecologists, bodhisattvas, change makers, symbiotic entrepreneurs, poets, 
painters, eco-dharmists, people ready to just be with what comes, good and bad.

In this unique program, residents will engage in a variety of Minimum Viable Practices (MVPs) such as shared cooking, 
mindful sitting, house care, circling, and gardening. These activities serve as a living laboratory to explore the 
intersection of individuality and community, challenging traditional perspectives, and cultivating a compassionate, 
cooperative ethos.

Beyond providing an unconventional living arrangement, the Bergerac Praxis Hub immerses residents 
in a vibrant community committed to the research and development of innovative practices. 
Building upon a previous season of sympoesis residencies, where themes like contemplative activism, 
eco-spirituality, interbeing, collective intelligence, and relational embodiment were explored, these 
practices are designed to inspire a compassionate lifestyle, ecological balance, and a shift from individual 
isolation to a sense of supportive community.

Regarding food, our house Tenzo, Valerie, will guide them through daily cooking practices rooted in the Zen 
tradition. With a century-long legacy of conscious food practice, Valerie will share her expertise and adapt 
these timeless wisdom to our modern times. This presence brings an additional layer of knowledge transmission, 
particularly in relation to the mindful preparation of our shared organic, plant-based meals.

For a monthly cost ranging 650-1050€ for bedding including utilities, plus a €450 monthly contribution towards food, 
residents will be able to contribute to daily collective practices 
and weekly circle sessions. They will also have the opportunity to partake in a training program aimed 
at embodying collective transformation.

Ideal candidates are those who resonate with these principles and practices and are ready to explore their impact on a 
personal and communal level. Interested individuals are encouraged to apply by July 30th, 2023, to join this groundbreaking 
venture that emphasizes compassionate living and the engagement in collective practices.
