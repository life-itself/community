This October we start our fall open residency. It’s a flexible space to relax and focus and to enjoy some conscious coliving. Running from October through December 2023, participation is open ranging from a week up to the full three months.

The residency offers space to do your work with a lightweight coordinating and developmental "frame".

It is open to all who wish to engage in practices: system-thinkers, researchers, spiritual ecologists, bodhisattvas, change makers, symbiotic entrepreneurs, poets, painters, eco-dharmists, people ready to just be with what comes, good and bad.

Residents will engage in a variety of Minimum Viable Practices (MVPs): shared cooking, silent sitting, house and garden care. Optionally there are a variety of other practices e.g. circling, systemic constellations, zen etc. These activities serve as a living laboratory to explore the intersection of individuality and community, challenging traditional perspectives, and cultivating a compassionate, cooperative ethos.

Beyond providing a conscious coliving arrangement, the Bergerac Praxis Hub immerses residents in a vibrant community committed to the research and development of innovative practices that our research team documents all year long.

Building upon a previous season of sympoesis residencies, where themes like contemplative activism, eco-spirituality, interbeing, collective intelligence, and relational embodiment were explored, these practices are designed to inspire a compassionate lifestyle, ecological balance, and a shift from individual isolation to a sense of supportive community. 

Regarding food, our house Tenzo, Valerie, will guide them through daily cooking practices rooted in the Zen 
tradition. With a century-long legacy of conscious food practice, Valerie will share her expertise and adapt 
these timeless wisdom to our modern times. This presence brings an additional layer of knowledge transmission.

Schedule (this indicative and will change with the needs of the participants):

- 7 to 8 am: just sitting in Dojo 
- 8h00-8h45 am  breakfast and dishes 
- 9-10am: collective care for cooking , cleaning, gardening
- 10-12h30: own time
- 13h00: buffet lunch and dishes
- 14h00-17h00: own time
- 17h30: body care 
- 19h00: table dinner and dishes

Besides the daily structure, there can be once a week a sharing and regulatory circle. In addition, participants may offer their own sessions to other residents.

Weekends don't have any frame. During that time spontanous cooking and eating organisation happens. This is a time that gives opportunity to discover surroundings such as Plum Village or prehistorical caves. 

For a monthly cost between 400 to 850 euros plus approx 300 euros for food and amenities. All food is organic plant-based.

Ideal candidates are those who resonate with these principles and practices and are ready to explore their impact on a 
personal and communal level.
