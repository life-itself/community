The focus of this residency  is less on individual development but more on the space and substance of our in-betweenness, including tensions and differences. Expect practices like Circling, Emergent Dialogue and various forms of collective inquiry into the mystery of “We”.. Every day, residents are supported by an invisible framework based on Minimum Viable Practices (MVPs): shared cooking, silent meditation, house cleaning and garden care, all of which help us navigate our emotions in a dynamic way. 

Regarding food, we use a system inspired by zen temples where everyone takes turns being daily head chef supported by the food guardian ( tenzo) to create a sustainable and nourrishing collective system. 

Schedule :

- 7-8 am: optional meditation in Dojo (just sitting)
- 8-9 am: optional breakfast 
- 9-10 am: collective care for cooking, cleaning, gardening
- 10 am-1 pm: own time
- 1-2 pm: buffet lunch and dishes
- 2-6:30pm: own time
- 6:30-7:30 pm: table dinner and dishes
- 8pm: optional evening activity 

Besides the daily structure, there is  a weekly sharing/compost circle and a weekly organisational lunch.

Weekends don't have any frame. During that time spontaneous cooking and eating organisation happens. This is a time that gives opportunity to discover surroundings such as Plum Village or prehistorical caves. 

The monthly cost ranges between 450 to 950 euros for lodging, depending on the room, plus 300 euros for food and amenities ( 10 euros/ day). All communal food is organic and plant-based.

Ideal candidates are those who resonate with these principles and practices, have a project to work on and are ready to explore being community.
