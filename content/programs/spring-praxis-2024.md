This residency will be hosted by Ivo Mensch ( Host)  supported by Lisa ( steward)  

In residency, participants arrive with a project or a question and explore it while being part of a systemic collective body. Every day, residents are supported by an invisible framework based on Minimum Viable Practices (MVPs): shared cooking, silent meditation, house cleaning and garden care, all of which help us navigate our emotions in a dynamic way. During the evenings, participants can share and test their practices within the group, and explore new ones - the activities can range from facilitated inquiries to singing nights to simply unwinding, with a mandatory weekly circle where we engage in deeper check-ins.

This Spring Praxis residency focuses on the question of leading a good life and what it means to be human in our time. Instead of following a strict program, it creates space to listen to what wants to emerge from the collective. On the way, we are feeling the rhythm of a community and observing how the system adapts to what unfolds - light or shadow.

Our time together and the diverse practices we encounter also nourish the living laboratory spirit of the hub. This spirit is aimed at exploring the practices that support groups, both on a personal and collective level, at the unique intersection of individuality and community. This approach challenges traditional perspectives and cultivates a compassionate, cooperative ethos.

Regarding food, we use a system inspired by zen temples will guide the group where everyone takes turns being daily head chef, getting the chance to explore different roles. 

Schedule :

- 7-8 am: optional meditation in Dojo (just sitting)
- 8-9 am: optional breakfast 
- 9-10 am: collective care for cooking, cleaning, gardening
- 10 am-1 pm: own time
- 1-2 pm: buffet lunch and dishes
- 2-6:30pm: own time
- 6:30-7:30 pm: table dinner and dishes
- 8pm: optional evening activity 

Besides the daily structure, there will be a weekly sharing/regulatory circle. Participants are invited to offer their own practices to other residents during the night sessions.

Weekends don't have any frame. During that time spontaneous cooking and eating organisation happens. This is a time that gives opportunity to discover surroundings such as Plum Village or prehistorical caves. 

The monthly cost ranges between 450 to 950 euros for lodging, depending on the room, plus approx. 300 euros for food and amenities ( 10 euros/ day). All communal food is organic and plant-based.

Ideal candidates are those who resonate with these principles and practices, have a project to work on and are ready to explore being community.
