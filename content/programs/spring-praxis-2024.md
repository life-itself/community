**The hosts of the Spring 2024 residency will be members of the Bergerac Hub Proto-Trustees group:**

**- April - Ivo J. Mensch (Perspectiva)** 
**- May - Liam Kavanagh (Climate Majority Project and co-founder of Life Itself)**

In this longer-term residency, participants arrive with a project or a question and explore it while being part of a systemic collective body. Every day, residents are supported by an invisible framework based on Minimum Viable Practices (MVPs): shared cooking, silent meditation, house cleaning and garden care, all of which help us navigate our emotions in a dynamic way. During the evenings, participants can share and test their practices within the group, and explore new ones - the activities can range from facilitated inquiries to singing nights to simply unwinding, with a mandatory weekly circle where we engage in deeper check-ins.

This Spring Praxis residency focuses on the question of leading a good life and what it means to be human in our time. Instead of following a strict program, it creates space to listen to what wants to emerge from the collective. On the way, we are feeling the rhythm of a community and observing how the system adapts to what unfolds - light or shadow.

Our time together and the diverse practices we encounter also nourish the living laboratory spirit of the hub. This spirit is aimed at exploring the practices that support groups, both on a personal and collective level, at the unique intersection of individuality and community. This approach challenges traditional perspectives and cultivates a compassionate, cooperative ethos.

This long-term residency allows the space for each to do their own remote work within a lightweight developmental "frame". A lot of us who are already here are using these months to focus on creative work, such as writing a book, painting, or designing courses.

It is open to all system-thinkers, researchers, spiritual ecologists, bodhisattvas, change makers, symbiotic entrepreneurs, poets, painters, eco-dharmists - any people ready to just be with what comes and welcome dancing within complexity.

Building upon a previous season of sympoesis residencies, where themes like contemplative activism, eco-spirituality, interbeing, collective intelligence, and relational embodiment were explored, the practices we engage in are designed to inspire a compassionate lifestyle, ecological balance, and a shift from individual isolation to a sense of supportive community. 

Regarding food, our house Tenzo, Valerie, will guide the group through daily cooking practices as part of the deliberately developmental technology of the hub where everyone takes turns being head chef every couple of days, getting the chance to explore different roles. 

Schedule (tentative and can change with the needs of the participants):

- 7-8 am: optional meditation in Dojo (just sitting)
- 8-9 am: optional breakfast 
- 9-10 am: collective care for cooking, cleaning, gardening
- 10 am-1 pm: own time
- 1-2 pm: buffet lunch and dishes
- 2-6:30pm: own time
- 6:30-7:30 pm: table dinner and dishes
- 8pm: optional evening activity 

Besides the daily structure, there will be a weekly sharing/regulatory circle. Participants are invited to offer their own practices to other residents during the night sessions.

Weekends don't have any frame. During that time spontaneous cooking and eating organisation happens. This is a time that gives opportunity to discover surroundings such as Plum Village or prehistorical caves. 

The monthly cost ranges between 450 to 950 euros for lodging, depending on the room, plus approx. 300 euros for food and amenities. All communal food is organic and plant-based.

Ideal candidates are those who resonate with these principles and practices, have a project to work on and are ready to explore being community.
