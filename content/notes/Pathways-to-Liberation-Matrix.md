A matrix of 28 skills and development "levels" in those skills. Created by Jacob Gotwals, Jack Lehman, Jim Manske and Jori Manske between 2008 and 2011 it comes from the [[NVC]] world but is broadly applicable. From the website https://pathwaystoliberation.com/the-matrix/:

> The Pathways to Liberation: Matrix of Self-Assessment (“the Matrix”) was developed to support self-assessment of the skills and consciousness of Nonviolent Communication (NVC). The Matrix is a collaborative project created by Jacob Gotwals, Jack Lehman, Jim Manske and Jori Manske. In 2008 we started writing about skills for transforming life and relationships, in the service of creating a world of personal and systemic wellbeing and collaboration. We worked together for 3 years to create a list of skills and a measure of their development from unknown to integrated.

## Full list of qualities and their short descriptions

- Presence: Being attentive to what is happening right now. Not lost in thinking, emotional reactions, etc.
- Observing: Noticing (and possibly describing) our sensory and mental experiences, and distinguishing these experiences from the interpretations we ascribe to them.

- Self-acceptance: Accepting oneself with unconditional caring.
- Taking ownership of one's feelings: Living from the knowledge that I alone cause my emotions - my emotions are not caused by others.
- Needs consciousness:   Awareness of (and the willingness to honor) needs, the essential universal elemental qualities of life (like sustenance, love and meaning).
- Reconnecting to self and recovering from reactivity: Reactivity is internal resistance to what is. Recovery is letting go of that resistance. Re-connecting to self is being with one's own experience with presence and compassion.
- Request consciousness & making requests: Willingness to ask for what one wants, with openness to any response; not attached to any particular outcome.
