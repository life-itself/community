**Welcome to the Once Upon a Time podcast series featuring the lives of ordinary people choosing an extra-ordinary path.** 

A collection of tales of ordinary people choosing an extra-ordinary life seedling a second renaissance. These pioneers saw something and acted upon their insights to bring forth a new world of an awakening society. This is how hope and faith spreads, with stories of transformation, embodied in ordinary people choosing an extra-ordinary path. 

We often wait for a kind of hero to appear. Yet, if you read about the greatest change makers of our world, one thing they have in common is their love of service. And when you look more deeply you will realize they are also ordinary people, who were dedicated to the pursuit of truth. What made them extra-ordinary is that what they were committed to was bigger than themselves. From their insights they took actions which is what birthed transformation. These stories are made up of moments of doubts about their chosen path, yet an unbroken faith remains to what they dedicated their lives to.

What makes them extra-ordinary is their commitment to something bigger than themselves. It is their repeated actions that speaks about the depth of their calling. In doing so their bravery and insanity brings forth a new possibility. They don’t look like the usual heroes, they are every day men and women weaving a new world.

In this series you will be taken deep into these ordinary peoples world's. Watch or listen to each episode below.
