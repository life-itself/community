## Here is a brief overview of what is included in each day:

**Day 1:** We examine what conflict is and why it arises. We’ll introduce you to the conflict within community and set the scene for the following days.

**Day 2:** We dive in to myth busting. We take the assumptions and pull them apart so you can approach conflict from a more neutral and grounded perspective.

**Day 3:**  We examine the greatest causes of conflict within community, why they occur and some insight into tips on how to approach them.

**Day 4:**  We tell you how to avoid conflict before it even happens and share tools and techniques which reduce the levels of conflict in a coliving environment.

**Day 5:**  We explore the self work, and characteristics needed to navigate situations of conflict. We’ll include tips and suggestions on how to enhance these characteristics to make sure you aren’t the sociopath in the group!

**Day 6:** We dive into conflict resolution processes. We outline key ones that we would recommend and talk you through them.

**Day 7:** On our final day, we tie it all together, and review what we’ve learnt from over the past 6 days, and where to go from here.
