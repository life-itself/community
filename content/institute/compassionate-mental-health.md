### Coming Home to Ourselves

**Coming Home to Ourselves** is a two day virtual gathering  to explore alternative approaches for living and working with mental distress, running June 23-25th 2021.

[**Life Itself**](https://lifeitself.org/about/) has co-created the programme, which builds on core themes of connection, community and compassionate systems change.

Together we’ll explore new ways of thinking about service provision, and how we care for ourselves and each other within our families, communities and workplaces. We’ll be moving away from labels that frame mental distress as disorders for life, and towards safe, healing mental health services that people want to use when they are in crisis. Register Today and join us in changing the conversation around mental health, challenging stigma and raising expectations.
