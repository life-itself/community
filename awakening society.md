An awakening society is a society oriented to "awakening": personal and collective development towards greater peace, freedom, insight and wisdom.

Development is "multi-dimensional" incorporating (at least) cognitive, emotional, spiritual, worldview and interpersonal aspects – or, in the phrase popular in the Integral community including waking up, growing up, cleaning up, showing up (spiritual growth, worldview evolution, therapeutic healing and service).

Put crudely, an awakening society is an **inner** growth society. This contrasts with (most) of today's society which are essentially **outer** growth societies.

Thus, the transition to an awakening society can be most simply described as a move from a focus on **outer growth** to **inner growth**.

> Collective development could be termed "cultural evolution" and personal development also known as inner development. Thus, an awakening society is one oriented to inner development and cultural evolution.

It is important to emphasize the integral aspect of an awakening society. Thus, whilst the inner aspects of development are emphasized, at least in contrast to many of today's societies, both inner and outer development are valued.[1](https://lifeitself.org/awakening-society#user-content-fn-1)

## On the Term Development

Following Wilber and DiPerna, we use the term "development" broadly and interchangeably with the term "transformation". It refer to our innate human capacity to both grow (and heal) through predicable, sequential patterns of mental, emotional, and spiritual unfolding.
