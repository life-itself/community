Consider that one of the greatest obstacles to our well-being is our
attachment to views — that we are right and others are wrong. As a
result, we find it hard to change our views and to hear others. This can
result in dogmatism, fanaticism and even violence both physical and
emotional. At a personal level, our attachment to views may be one of
the greatest obstacle to our own well-being and enlightenment because of
the difficulty we face relinquishing deep-rooted beliefs in an
inherently existing ‘self’ or ‘I’.[^2]

In this primer we look at three areas related to this issue. First, we
look at what we mean by attachment and non-attachment to views and their
relationship to engagement and detachment. We clarify that
non-attachment is not **de-**attachment but rather un-attached
engagement and open-mindedness.

Second, we present the scientific evidence that we are attached to
views: that we resist changing our views despite strong, contrary
evidence. We discuss various reasons why that might be and the impact of
this materially and spiritually.

Third, we explore the deeper connections with ontology and our ideas of
self in philosophy and Buddhism.

## What are Attachment and Non-Attachment?

Ordinarily we think of attachment as something positive or even neutral:
I’m attached to this old watch because my father gave it to me, or the
boat is attached to the shore by a rope. And conversely to be unattached
offers sounds a bit negative. For example, if you say “I’m unattached”
it means you are without a romantic relationship — whereas to be
attached is to have one (observe that common slang for getting married
is to “get hitched” which roughly approximates to to “get attached”).

And this sense is still there when it comes to views. Not to be attached
to a view is to be *de*-tached. Whilst there can be a positive sense of
dispassionate and independent as in “the judge considered the arguments
with a sense of detachment”, there is also the sense of uninvolved and
uncaring: “the man watched the dogs attack the fox with an air of
detachment”.

Thus our use of attachment may be surprising. In ordinary english
attachment is often used in as positive context: we are attached to
places, people and things that we like and care about. Conversely, the
opposite of attachment — *de*tachment — has a mildly negative sense of
emotionless unconcern, anomie, lifelessness — “he kissed her with an air
of detachment”, “he lived detached, absent, as if something were
permanently missing”.

Our use of attachment and non-attachment are somewhat special and rather
specific. It derives from a Buddhist tradition. In that tradition
“attachment” is the translation for key concept around the way that we
“cling” to things: experiences, things, ideas, even consciousness. It
can be found as a key phrase in translations of the Four Noble Truths,
the core teachings of the Buddha[^3]:

1.  Life involves suffering

2.  Suffering arises from *attachment* \[also translated as “craving”,
    > “clinging to” …\]

3.  Suffering ceases when *attachment* ceases

4.  Freedom from suffering is possible by practicing the Eightfold Path

The special usage also explains why we use *non-*attachment rather than
*de*-tachment as the contrast to attachment. Non-attachment, which is
our focus here, is not detachment. It is not simply an absence, a lack
of attachment. Rather it is something positive, a positive choice that
makes true engagement and commitment possible.

Consider an analogy with listening. When we listen to another person we
can listen in several ways. One way to listen is to do passively. It is
listening just as not talking but without really engaging with what the
person is saying. What they say comes in our ears but we do not really
hear it or listen to it in a true sense. This is “detached” listening.
On the other hand, there are times when we truly listen and listen
deeply. This is an active not a passive act. Where actively engage
ourselves with what they are saying, opening our mind to it, positively
welcoming what they are saying.

## Common garden examples of attachment

### Research on Attachment to Views

***Misinformation, False Beliefs and Cognition***

If we look around us: at newspapers, at our friends, even in our own
lives, it becomes clear that misinformation is ubiquitous, and that
false and erroneous beliefs are widespread and persistent.

For example, over half of all voters in Republican Primaries in 2011
were “birthers” who believed that President Obama was not born in the
United States despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary. Or the fact
that a sizeable minority in Britain and the United States now believe,
erroneously, in a link between vaccination and autism thanks to a single
1998 study which was widely reported at the time but subsequently
discredited. This has had a large impact for public health as parents
refuse to vaccinate their children resulting in a significant number of
preventable deaths and illness.[^4]

There is now a sizeable body of scientific research on why false beliefs
persist.

What are we interested in?

-   Conclusive evidence that a) people have false beliefs b) that these
    > persist in face of presentation of contradictory evidence c) why
    > that is — what cognitive and ontological mechanisms are at work d)
    > what practical recommendations would come out of this for creating
    > open-mindedness and non-attachment to views

-   Questions: framing in terms of “false” belief and misinformation

-   People don’t change views -&gt; they discard ignore or dismiss
    > contradictory evidence -&gt; they do this because it conflicts
    > with / threatens the security of their identity (ego) -&gt; leads
    > us into ontology -&gt; buddhist attachment to views -&gt; becoming
    > more open-mindedness requires addressing our attachment -&gt;
    > buddhist practice (e.g. meditation) as this generates awareness
    > and equanamity, which then can lead to a falling away of our
    > attachment

A real world impact of “attachment” (Lewandowsky et al. 2012, pp.
106-107):

> Speers, 2003). More worryingly still, a substantial number of health

It is not just the facts, it is the narrative we tell about the facts
(“[*I don’t want to be
right*](http://www.newyorker.com/science/maria-konnikova/i-dont-want-to-be-right)”):

Denial vs healthy scepticism


### A Loving Father Rejects His Son

*From The Art of Power by Thich Nhat Hanh, pp.87-89*

The Buddha told the story of a merchant, a widower, who went away in a
business trip and left his little boy at home. While he was away,
bandits came and burned down the whole village. When the merchant
returned, he didn’t find his house, it was just a heap of ash. There was
the charred body of a child close by. He threw himself on the ground and
cried and cried. He beat his chest and pulled his hair. The next day, he
had the little body cremated. Because his beloved son was his only
reason for existence, he sewed a beautiful velvet bag and put the ashes
inside. Wherever he went, he took that bag of ashes with him. Eating,
sleeping, working, he always carried it with him.

In fact, his son had been kidnapped by the bandits. Three months later,
the boy escaped and returned home. When he arrived, it was two o’clock
in the morning. He knocked on the door of the new house his father had
built. The poor father was lying on his bed crying, holding the bag of
ashes, and he asked, ‘Who is there?’ ‘It’s me, Daddy, your son.’ The
father answered, ‘That’s not possible. My son is dead. I’ve cremated his
body and I carry his ashes with me. You must be some naughty boy who’s
trying to fool me. Go away, don’t disturb me!’ He refused to open the
door, and there was no way for the little boy to come in. The boy had to
go away, and the father lost his son forever.

After telling the story, the Buddha said, ‘If at some point in your life
you adopt an idea or a perception as the absolute truth, you close the
door of your mind. This is the end of seeking the truth. And not only do
you no longer seek the truth, but even if the truth comes in person and
knocks on your door, you refuse to open it. Attachment to views,
attachment to ideas, attachment to perceptions are the biggest obstacle
to the truth.’

### Buddhism, non-attachment and misunderstandings …

People seem to hear the 4NT and attachment part as: “life is about the
cessation of suffering, detachment is the way to do, just hook yourself
up to a morphine drip”. And normally react to that like: “No, i don’t
want to have a lobotomy, I want to live and experience and i accept
suffering etc etc. See e.g. for a fairly nuanced look at this which
still seems to go down this route:
[*http://gretachristina.typepad.com/greta\_christinas\_weblog/2010/03/secular-buddhism.html*](http://gretachristina.typepad.com/greta_christinas_weblog/2010/03/secular-buddhism.html)

E.g. you have translations like:

-   Life is suffering.

-   The origin of suffering is attachment.

-   The cessation of suffering is attainable.

-   The path to the cessation of suffering is eightfold path

In my view, this is an misinterpretation. It equates non-attachment with
detachment rather than engagement.

Mis-interpretation

-   Getting a lobotomy

-   Living in a hut in the forest

-   Having no possessions

-   Never doing what you enjoy because you get attached to it …

The truth is ***peace and the ultimate freedom can be obtained right
here within everyday life.*** So then if stripping yourself of all
possessions and worldly responsibility isn’t the point of
non-attachment, what is?


## Metaphors

Clench / unclench

![](vault/assets/notebook/hand-and-fist.jpg)

```
Attachment ... Detachment
    |

    V
Engagement
```

People think of non-attachment = opposite = detachment = apathy,
disengagement, absence etc …

Not so!

Non-attachment != Detachment but rather = Engagement without attachment


## Random Stuff

[*http://gretachristina.typepad.com/greta\_christinas\_weblog/2010/03/secular-buddhism.html*](http://gretachristina.typepad.com/greta_christinas_weblog/2010/03/secular-buddhism.html)

In the world of clinical psychology and social work, among attachment
theorists and clinicians who study crying and grief, there are some who
make a distinction between "sad crying" and "protest crying." "Protest
crying" expresses the refusal to accept loss. It treats the fact of loss
as a terrible injustice, and demands an immediate return of whatever it
is that's been lost. It says, "I don't want this, and I don't accept
it." (Not coincidentally, "protest crying" is more likely to elicit a
hostile or irritated reaction from others, since it's out of proportion,
disconnected from reality, and makes people feel manipulated.)

"Sad crying," on the other hand, expresses despair over loss. It
expresses our recognition that whatever's been lost is really gone, and
expresses our feelings of grief about it. It says, "I don't want this,
but I understand that this is how it is." (And it's more likely to
elicit sympathy and compassion and attachment from other people... the
good kind of attachment, the clinical- psychology "connecting with
others" definition of attachment, not the bad Buddhist definition.)

Crudely: Prior experience gets in the way of finding new ways of doing

The counter-intuitive possibility that prior knowledge can have a
negative effect on

future performance is a theme in a range of areas of psychology that at
first sig

ht might seem unrelated. For example, in negative transfer paradigms
previous experience make it more difficult to adapt to a new setting
than it would be without such experience.

### Nice Example of Retained Beliefs

[*http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/ideomotor.html*](http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/ideomotor.html)

Some years ago I participated in a test of applied kinesiology at Dr.
Wallace Sampson's medical office in Mountain View, California. A team of
chiropractors came to demonstrate the procedure. Several physician
observers and the chiropractors had agreed that chiropractors would
first be free to illustrate applied kinesiology in whatever manner they
chose. Afterward, we would try some double-blind tests of their claims.

The chiropractors presented as their major example a demonstration they
believed showed that the human body could respond to the difference
between glucose (a "bad" sugar) and fructose (a "good" sugar). The
differential sensitivity was a truism among "alternative healers,"
though there was no scientific warrant for it. The chiropractors had
volunteers lie on their backs and raise one arm vertically. They then
would put a drop of glucose (in a solution of water) on the volunteer's
tongue. The chiropractor then tried to push the volunteer's upraised arm
down to a horizontal position while the volunteer tried to resist. In
almost every case, the volunteer could not resist. The chiropractors
stated the volunteer's body recognized glucose as a "bad" sugar. After
the volunteer's mouth was rinsed out and a drop of fructose was placed
on the tongue, the volunteer, in just about every test, resisted
movement to the horizontal position. The body had recognized fructose as
a "good" sugar.

After lunch a nurse brought us a large number of test tubes, each one
coded with a secret number so that we could not tell from the tubes
which contained fructose and which contained glucose. The nurse then
left the room so that no one in the room during the subsequent testing
would consciously know which tubes contained glucose and which fructose.
The arm tests were repeated, but this time they were double-blind --
neither the volunteer, the chiropractors, nor the onlookers was aware of
whether the solution being applied to the volunteer's tongue was glucose
or fructose. As in the morning session, sometimes the volunteers were
able to resist and other times they were not. We recorded the code
number of the solution on each trial. Then the nurse returned with the
key to the code. When we determined which trials involved glucose and
which involved fructose, there was no connection between ability to
resist and whether the volunteer was given the "good" or the "bad"
sugar.

When these results were announced, the head chiropractor turned to me
and said, "You see, that is why we never do double-blind testing
anymore. It never works!" At first I thought he was joking. It turned it
out he was quite serious. Since he "knew" that applied kinesiology
works, and the best scientific method shows that it does not work, then
-- in his mind -- there must be something wrong with the scientific
method. This is both a form of loopholism as well as an illustration of
what I call the plea for special dispensation. Many pseudo- and
fringe-scientists often react to the failure of science to confirm their
prized beliefs, not by gracefully accepting the possibility that they
were wrong, but by arguing that science is defective.

Speculation on Why We Are Attached to Views \[Game Theory and Evolutionary Biology\]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why do we have such strong commitment to views. In particular, why do we
seem to emotionally involved in what we believe: finding ourselves angry
and upset when our beliefs are threatened? (Think of that common
agreement to have no religion or politics at the dinner table or in bars
because it leads to unpleasant disagreements — even violence).

Here I’m going to offer up some suggestions. These are a bit tongue in
cheek:

### Commitment problem

Basic idea: emotional “attachment” to our views is a solution to a
commitment problem of credibility with others.

Abe and Ben are hunter gatherers. Abe says to Ben: I’ve seen lots of
nice Moose over that hill.

Should Ben believe Abe and spend a day trekking over the hill to find
the Moose? After all:

A.  Mistaken

    a.  Abe could be talking out of his ass (he just says stuff like
        > this all the time)

    b.  Yes, he has some evidence but not a lot

B.  Lying

If “talk is cheap” then Ben probably should not believe Abe as there is
no reason that Abe has very high credibility — one of those three
options is probably true.

However, suppose instead that talk is not cheap: that Ben knows that Abe
really likes to be right. That he gets upset and angry when he is wrong,
or, that gets really guilty and stressed. Then that fact really adds
weight to Abe’s claim. After all if Ben does go over the hill and finds
no moose there will be an emotional cost for Abe.

=&gt; This makes Ben more likely to believe Abe.

And, of course, this emotional cost to being wrong and payoff to being
right will not just be limited to the location of Moose. It will
naturally spread to include all beliefs and opinions we hazard.

This will quickly become a barrier to updating one’s views and opinions
if it is associated with “being wrong”. Such commitments to one’s
pre-existing views and opinions will even spread to abstract ideas like
belief in God. It may become so emotionally welded to our sense of
identity and self that it is strong enough that we will kill for our
views and opinions — and admire those who do.

Furthermore, such strong feelings create problems for changing our views
especially when combined with the inevitable uncertainty of life. To to
back to our story: perhaps the moose are not always in the same place,
so the moose being absent when Ben goes over the hill does not
necessarily mean that Abe was mistaken and Abe has a strong reason to
interpret the data that way. With uncertainty we all now we have a valid
reason to ignore and even discard new data points that are inconsistent
with our pre-existing beliefs.

**Aside: lying.** The above explanation talks more to option (A) case of
genuine mistake. However, the logic also applies in the lying case.
Lying would also potentially have evolutionary benefits — Abe wants Ben
to go to the wrong place so that Abe gets food and Ben does not etc.
However, to lie well requires you to be credible. Once again either
having or being able to fake a real emotional cost to being wrong is
valuable. In addition, with lying the ability to deceive yourself is
very valuable — the best liars are the ones who believe their own lies.
Thus, the lying option would also encourage a mechanism for deceiving
ourselves. This mechanism would contribute even more to our tendency to
ignore or dismiss evidence which contradicts our pre-existing views.

**Background: Commitment Problems**

Suppose two robbers Abe and Ben rob a jewellery store. After the robbery
they need to split up to reduce their risk of being caught. In addition,
it is best if only one of them looks after the loot. In addition, Abe
has all the contacts needed to sell it.

However, Ben is worried that if Abe has the loot then he may just run
off it with himself. What can they do?

The issue here is what game theorists like to call a time inconsistency
problem: at the moment just after the robbery the best thing is for them
to split up and only one of them to hold on to the loot. But once they
have done that, whomever has the loot has an incentive to make off with
it all themselves. If they cannot solve this issue they may be forced to
do something less optimal: split up the proceeds right now even though
that exposes them to more risk and they won’t get as good a price, or to
stay together to sell the proceeds together which is even riskier.

What is really wanted here is way for Abe to make a **credible**
commitment to Ben that he will not run off. This is good for both Abe
and Ben — they will both end up with less risk and get more money.

A credible commitment for Abe needs to involve something with a greater
cost than the benefit of ripping Ben off and taking all the loot for
himself. One option might be that Abe’s daughter is married to Ben’s
son. In that case, ripping Ben off will cause huge harm to his family.
Another option might be that Abe knows Ben is a crazy guy who will stop
at nothing if he is taken advantage of, that Ben would track him down
and kill him — even if that meant risking huge jail time — just to get
even if Abe ripped him off. Though it might sound bad, Ben being crazy
in this sense would actually be good for Abe as it would provide a way
for Abe to make a credible promise to Ben — Ben would know that Abe knew
that he is a crazy guy and would trust Abe not to rip him off.

*The other classic example is nuclear weapons. Remember Dr Strangelove
and the Russian’s Doomsday Machine*

A classic issue in game theory is how to solve commitment problems.
