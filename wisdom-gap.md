# Wisdom Gap

The contention that there is a large and growing gap between our technological capabilities and our individual and collective wisdom to use them well.

## Examples

## Bridging the Wisdom Gap (Geoff Mulgan and Rufus Pollock, 2020)

> We propose that getting wiser personally and collectively is central to addressing critical challenges ranging from mental health to climate change.
> 
> **1. There is a wisdom gap**: Our technological powers have expanded dramatically as have the complexities of our societies. These increases place greater demands on us to make “wiser” choices personally and collectively.  Yet our wisdom has not kept up as evidenced by, for example, the growing crises in the climate and mental health. In short, there appears to be a growing wisdom gap.

## Scott Atran, In Gods we Trust

Preface title:

> Stone Age Minds for a Space Age World

## Edward O. Wilson, The Social Conquest of Earth (2012)

> We have created a Star Wars civilization, with Stone Age emotions, medieval institutions, and godlike technology.

Fuller version:

> Humanity today is like a waking dreamer, caught between the fantasies of sleep and the chaos of the real world. The mind seeks but cannot find the precise place and hour. **We have created a Star Wars civilization, with Stone Age emotions, medieval institutions, and godlike technology.** We thrash about. We are terribly confused by the mere fact of our existence, and a danger to ourselves and to the rest of life.

> I also have other fears about the impact of the digital on our well-being. In fact, I must confess I am something of a hopeful pessimist. I write the Open Revolution not because I am confident of our future but because I am so afraid – and, as Hemingway said, the world is a fine place and worth fighting for. We have better angels of our nature and we should attend to them. That does not mean I am confident we will listen.[1](https://rufuspollock.com/2019/04/08/children-playing-with-sharp-knives-humanity-and-the-digital-age/#fn:1)
> 
> My basic concern here is simple: that there is a fantastic mismatch between our “emotional-spiritual” maturity and our “techno-intellectual” maturity.
> 
> “Techno-intellectually” we started from a zero base a few hundred thousand years ago: without language, without tools, and as a tiny part of a vast ecosystem. Having discovered language and tools we began to advance and over the last five thousand or so, and especially over the last three hundred we have hit the exponential fast forward button. We created cities, we built roads and railroads, we flew aeroplanes and space-shuttles, we discovered anti-septics and penicillin, made the phone, the computer and Internet. And the latter all within a generation.
> 
> And the digital really takes this to a different level because that world – the world we live in now – is the world of Moore’s “law” which states that computation power per unit cost _doubles_ every 18 months. That’s exponential growth on steroids. It means that since 1985, which some of us can actually _remember_, computers have got a _million_ times more powerful for the same cost (or, equivalently, a million times cheaper) – a computer costing $10,000 in 1985 would cost a cent today.

> So here we stand, developing and evolving digital technology faster, literally, than we can comprehend.
> 
> And on the other side we have, comparatively, the emotional and spiritual maturity of a small infant. We have barely developed at all for the last few hundred thousand years. We still fight wars, commit everyday violence verbal and physical, and, perhaps most importantly, have incredibly limited self-control and self-awareness. Most of us live as dodgem cars, often out of control, careering through life bumping, sometimes violently, into things and people. Right now, as a group, we have such limited ability to coordinate and reflect that we are putting our entire environment and very existence at risk through climate change.
