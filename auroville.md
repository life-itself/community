From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirra_Alfassa

> The Mother was a revered yoga teacher in a modern context.[32] On 24 November 1926, later declared as Siddhi Day (Victory Day) and still celebrated by Sri Aurobindo Ashram,[33] Mother and Sri Aurobindo declared that overmind consciousness had manifested directly in physical consciousness, allowing the possibility for human consciousness to be directly aware and be in the overmind consciousness

Milestones in development:

- Around 1924: formation of the Ashram "With time many influenced by Arya Magazine and others who had heard about Sri Aurobindo started to come to his residence either permanently to reside or to practise Sri Aurobindo's yoga. ... Around 1924 onwards ... the house was turning into an ashram with many followers flowing in every day."
- April 1930: Aurobindo clarifies in writing that Mother is in charge of the Ashram
- Aug 1930: Ashram has 80-100 members.
- 1937: Ashram grown to over 150. start construction on new buildings (took 10y to construct)

Asides

- cf [[notes/lay-awakening|Lay Awakening]]: re [[notes/integral-yoga|integral yoga]] "This yoga was in variance with older ways of yoga because the follower would not give up the outer life to live in a monastery, but would be present in regular life and practise spirituality in all parts of life."
