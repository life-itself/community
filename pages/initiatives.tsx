                <p>How do we bring about the shifts in being, culture and systems necessary to
                    transform our social paradigm, and steer humanity and the planet into a flourishing future?</p>

                <p>Here at Life Itself, we engage in many different initiatives. Some are experiments, others stand
                    alone works, and others are ongoing explorations. All are designed to create a wiser, weller world.
                    Our projects fall under two broad themes:</p>

                <h3>Pioneering Community Living</h3>

                <p>At the core of what we do is the thesis that community living is key to embodying true transformation
                    of ourselves and society.</p>

                <p>Why is community living so important? Because we need to combine inner transformation and outer development.
                    This is difficult, but living in a conscious community makes it easier. You have mutual support, accountability,
                    responsibility, connection.</p>

                <p>This is why we dedicate ourselves to creating pathways and providing tools for people to live in intentional communities.</p>

                <h3>Transforming the Narrative</h3>

                <p>We are undergoing one of the greatest paradigm shifts in history. At itâ€™s foundations this shift requires a new way of being and new ways of doing.</p>

                <p>Our work brings inner transformation out of the domain of the purely spiritual, and seeks to cement it as a pillar of social change that works for all. We use rigorous enquiry and sensemaking to better understand how we can make this paradigm shift a positive transformation for society.</p>
