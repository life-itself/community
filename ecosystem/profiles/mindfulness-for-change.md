Mindfulness for Change is designed to serve people who are connected with that heartfelt intention to do some good in the world, and help you to connect to like-minded people in community. 

As a community we're in a process of learning to support each other in the work, or to find whatever the work is for us. The work could be hugely diverse - there are so many ways of making change. Mindfulness for Change hosts online and offline spaces for community to form.
