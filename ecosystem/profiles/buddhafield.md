Buddhafield is a collaboration of Buddhists involved with the Triratna Buddhist Community: some of us are members of the Triratna Buddhist Order. We live all over the UK, but we run a programme of camping activities in the South of England, focused around the teaching and practice of Buddhism and Buddhist meditation. We are perhaps best known for organising our own Festival and for the Buddhafield Cafe, which goes to festivals and fairs like Glastonbury, Sunrise and The Green Gathering. As well as this, we run an annual programme of meditation retreat camps and we cultivate on our own land.
