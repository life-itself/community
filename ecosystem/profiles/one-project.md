One Project is a non-profit initiative working globally with communities to design, implement, and scale new forms of governance and economics that are equitable, ecological, and effective.

This is a moment of accelerating risk and opportunity. The time is now to co-create new social operating systems that leverage and cultivate the wisdom of humanity, fulfill the promise of democracy, and create a fairer, more abundant future.

One Project is a values-driven organization undertaking this work with great care and humility. We are committed to integrating a diverse array of voices, perspectives, and decision-makers at every level of our process. We do not seek to impose any particular system on communities. Rather we help communities think deeply about their problems, and then co-create potential solutions.
