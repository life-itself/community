Enspiral is a network of people working on stuff that matters. Our mission is to support people who want to spend their lives changing the world.

Enspiral started with a vision to support more people to spend their lives working to solve the greatest challenges of our time. A comunity testing ways of working together with trust and respect to share money, information and control as openly as possible. As a community weâ€™ve supported hundreds of people to launch and build all sorts of initiatives, projects and world-changing ventures. an active network of 150+ contributors and friends from New Zealand and around the world, we participate together to support and amplify our individual purpose, and steward the collective to its highest potential impact.
