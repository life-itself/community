We are a global initiative co-created with Ashoka, Esalen, Impact Hub, Porticus, the Skoll Foundation and Synergos. Our work is about demonstrating how individual and organisational wellbeing can be cultivated, building credible research, hosting a community of global and regional organisations in learning and putting this into practice, and storytelling.
