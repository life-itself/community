Metamoderna is a political and philosophical think-tank, the purpose of which is to contribute to a fundamental shift in society – in a Nordic and eventually a global context. 

This societal shift is based upon a set of political-philosophical changes of perspective, from the modern to the metamodern society. It entails qualitative developments of society in a culturally and politically progressive, green direction. The think-tank Metamoderna does not work towards “more of the same” as in today’s society, but rather, towards a new kind of society.
