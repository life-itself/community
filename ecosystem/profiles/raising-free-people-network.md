Raising Free People Network helps families, organizations, and corporations to examine, assess, and solve big issues in education, leadership, and personal development. By tapping into techniques and philosophies from the unschooling and deschooling movements, our network uses independent broadcast media along with live trainings and events to sustain cultures of belonging, equity, and confident autonomy.
