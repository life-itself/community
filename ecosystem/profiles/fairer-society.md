We are a small sociocratic worker cooperative, dedicated to building a fairer society one community at a time. A fairer society is one where everyone has what they need to thrive, has a real say in matters that concern them, and where human prosperity is good for the Earth. We help people to create or acquire the things that matter to them, like housing, food, transport, energy, and the places where they work, and to run them in deeply collaborative ways.
