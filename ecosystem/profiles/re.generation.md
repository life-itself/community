While phasing out the industries that are inherently out of step with natural processes, can we actively implement new processes and technologies that are inherently regenerative by design, thereby restoring resilience to the biosphere, regenerating biodiversity, habitats and communities around the globe, through a combination of circular economics; decentralised, bioregional governance; restorative ecological design; regenerative farming and renewable energy technologies? And if so, how will this be possible?

These are the crucial questions that The Re-Generation will address.
