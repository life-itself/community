The thesis of The Daily Evolver is that life is animated by the power of evolution, inside and out, and that we are riding a geyser of emergence toward a sacred world. In this blog I will make that case or grow trying!
Alas, geyser riding is harrowing and I, like you, plainly see the suffering world. But what we also see is the arc of history, where with all of humanity’s wrong turns and regressions there emerges a clear trajectory of people (in the aggregate) living longer, more peacefully and with more wealth, century by century. A process that is accelerating.

In this view suffering is a call to action. None of us really achieves happiness until all beings achieve happiness. Thus, there is no end of work to do. But, please people, let’s do it with joy in our hearts, because we are on a sacred journey. And considering we crawled out of the mud, we’re doing pretty darn well.

This is what I try to point out on this blog. I am a current events junkie and delight in interpreting emerging politics and culture through a lens of consciousness evolution.

So to make virtue out of passion, I offer The Daily Evolver.
