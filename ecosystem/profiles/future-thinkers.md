We live in an era of compunding crises. Economic crisis, meaning crisis, climate crisis, health crisis, pandemic.

To survive and thrive in this century, we have to deeply adapt to the changing world. We have to redesign our systems not to be merely sustainable (maintaininng things or not doing further harm), but to actually be regenerative (returning living systems to health and full capacity).

Future Thinkers Smart Village is a vision for a regenerative living lab and education center to be built in the beautiful Wells Gray country, BC, Canada.

Our living lab will work to prototypes in the areas of natural building, permaculture and food production, health &amp; wellness, regenerative business and economy, decentralized technology, community organization, new forms of governance, and whole systems design.

Our aim is to create processes and templates that other communities can use to regenerate the health of the bioregional ecosystem, the local communities, and the people living in them.
