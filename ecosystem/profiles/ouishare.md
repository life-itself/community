Ouishare connects people and accelerates projects for systemic change. 

We question and experiment with social models based on collaboration, openness, and fairness. 

We proudly have 60+ Connectors in 20 cities, organized + 300 events including 10 international conferences and published 9 research studies since 2012. - we feel uncomfortable with solutionism and its underlying mandate: measure, innovate, accelerate. 

Addressing the pains of our times is no longer a question of tech, data or AI. We are convinced that digital technology is neither the problem, nor the solution- more than anything, it distracts us from asking the important questions.  

Ouishare questions the status quo, instigates encounters between actors from different corners of society and is a leader in creating forms of collaboration. Our work is defined by long term thinking, listening, dialogue. We work at the intersections to create bridges between knowledge, skills and experiences, to shift societal power dynamics. 

Ouishare is an international network defined by five values: collaboration, openness, care, do-cracy and permanent beta. A non-profit started in France in 2012, today Ouishareâ€™s network spans from Europe to Latin and North America, to the Middle-East.
