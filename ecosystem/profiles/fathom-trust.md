We are building a network of educational and therapeutic communities to help people suffering with stress, fatigue, and physical and psychological conditions to learn to live well and create social, economic, and spiritual renewal.

Our hubs bring together a network of craftspeople by providing workshops, materials, teaching and marketing opportunities. Our approach creates opportunities for the older generation to contribute their skills and time whilst experiencing the solidarity that comes from seeing young people thrive in community.
