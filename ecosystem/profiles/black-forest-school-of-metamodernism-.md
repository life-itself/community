Post Post what?

What are you talking about, Doc? 
U r experienzink—or rather, continuouzly re-experienzink zhe Poztmodernizt Angzt ov zhe Labyrinth. ….'
(Postpostmodern Angst Disorder - Metamodernist Poetry, M. H. Frost)

Our quest from a Black Forest point of view is how to navigate within the labyrinth of a post(traumatized) modernity. Or to be blunt: How can we overcome the continuous re-experience of the postmodern angst of the labyrinth and face the traumatized collective memory of modernity? 

The task of black forest metamodernism is not to walk the talk, it is to stop, and to fall into love. Love as a structurally transcending force, with love beauty can be found even in the trauma of the meaning crises. After all, it was the lover of Theseus in the old minotaur myth that gave him the red thread. We can’t find this thread alone, it grows from one heart to another heart. An unfolding process towards resonance coherence and clarity. 

Metamodernism today can be seen differinitiated in the cultural in-between, the political after and the mystical beyond. Black Forest Metamodernism uniqueness is to start with the natural underneath. What is the ground, the field of attention modernity and postmodernity grew from? On what soil do we place our feet? Rather then going in-between, after or beyond we go underneath.To make the invisible visible. To disolve the trauma of modernity means to ground, compost and heal the postpostmodern angst disorder.
