RatPark is a culture hackerspace that provides basic necessities — food, housing, and community — for free, to any hacktivist.hacktivism (a portmanteau of hack and activism) is the use of technology to promote social change who wants to join an environment that enables true selflessness. The goal is to combine the support of an intentional community, the dynamism of a hackathon, and the freedom from the daily demands of the current socioeconomic system — to reason and hack collaboratively towards a more equitable world. The first park is currently under construction.
