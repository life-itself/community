In late 2018, Richard D. Bartlett published a proposal to start a "microsolidarity" group â€” a small mutual aid community for people to do a kind of personal development, in good company, for social benefit.

Since then, an open research network has been gradually self-organising around this concept and these practices.
This website is the central hub to collect resources for the co-development of multiple such communities. The most useful material is currently here: methods for cultivating Crews for peer-to-peer support in tiny groups.
