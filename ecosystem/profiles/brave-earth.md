Brave Earth (Tierra Valiente) is a burgeoning community, regenerative farm, and healing arts center based in northern Costa Rica. Here amidst the jungle, thermal pools and cloud forest, we are exploring new and ancient ways of living.
Regenerative design uses whole systems thinking to create resilient and equitable systems that integrate the needs of society with the integrity of Nature. 
We believe it requires bravery to step out of the traditional constructs of globalized monoculture and step into alternative systems grounded in the reality of what is possible when we align ourselves to the wisdom and power of Nature.
