Mindvalley creates the world’s best programs in every category of human transformation (and now entrepreneurship). Learn from the best teachers on our powerful science-based learning platform.


Being Human is more than just what our broken education system makes it out to be. We teach the world the art of truly living extraordinary, fulfilling, happy lives.

Global change and new technologies like AI are disrupting work and careers. Traditional education never prepared you for this. We teach you how to thrive in this new world -- with education that really matters for 2021 and beyond. But we don’t just stop with great education - we use AI and new technologies to create a powerful global network for you, connecting you with the right people, connections and transformation to build your best life.
