We explore how to address the complex social and ecological challenges of our time, through whole-person and whole-system transformational learning and action. Run gatherings and create communities. 

We are a worldwide community of people aspiring to take wise and courageous action to address the complex challenges of our time – climate disruption, racism and nationalism, economic inequality, political divisiveness, species extinction, etc – in ways that create connection, heal separation, and serve the well-being of all life. 

We believe that engaging these polarizing challenges requires us to hold multiple perspectives, ground our action in inner and interpersonal work, and cultivate embodied understanding of individual and collective trauma and oppression.
