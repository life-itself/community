# Dewitt et al 2016: A new tool to map the major worldviews in the Netherlands and USA, and explore how they relate to climate change

By [[Annick de Witt]]

## Commentary

ðŸš§

- ðŸ«¢ Aside: use the classic angle of climate change to motivate (and likely fund) the paper. Pure cultural evolution work would likely not get funded i suspect.
- ðŸŽ‰ Create a proper worldview questionnaire and try it out with a representative sample in the Netherlands and the US.

### How they developed the scale

> We used the Integrative Worldview Framework (De Witt & Hedlund, in press; Hedlund-de Witt, 2013a; Hedlund-de Witt et al., 2014) as theoretical background and blueprint for developing the worldview-scale. The IWF operationalizes the concept of worldview through distinguishing between five different aspects of worldviews (ontology, epistemology, axiology, anthropology, and societal vision), as well as four different categories of worldviews (traditional, modern, postmodern, and integrative).
