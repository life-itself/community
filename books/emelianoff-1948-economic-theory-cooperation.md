# Theory of Cooperation by Emelianoff (1948)

### Why [[abc/worker-coops]] struggle because of lack of capital, lack of marketing and lack of discipline

Coops struggle in these three areas for clear reasons. First, coops have no way to take equity which makes raising capital hard. Second, marketing is hard both because of lack of capital, and, more significantly, the issue of how to capture and allocate value added in a team (marketing is something that benefits everyone but it is hard to assess). Third, the disciple issue relates to basic problem of teamwork in egalitarian teams.

p.24 of Theory of Cooperation

> Two ever-recurring assumptions underlie the generally professed ideology of the productive associations, says Dr. Fuchs:  
> 
> a) emancipation of labor from the yoke of capital through productive associations, and  
> b) the securing by the workingmen of the "whole product of their   labor" after elimination of the capitalistic entrepreneur in the productive associations.  
> 
> The productive association, therefore, is assumed as representing an industrial form of the coming economic era; it is "an anticipation of the future." Further, productive associations have always played an extraordinary role in the interpretations of cooperation and a miserable part in actual life. Ninety years of experimentation and thousands of trials in different countries have proved, beyond any possibility of doubt, that productive cooperative associations are doomed to die sooner or later. Those few which survive change their economic character so radically that no sign of the cooperative association can be found in the new body. "The law of transformation" of the productive cooperatives formulated by F. Oppenheimer is perfectly justified by a history of productive associations, says Dr. Fuchs, ยนยน and this law declares: It is exceptionally seldom that a productive association lives till the blooming season and if it survives till this age it ceases to be a productive association."51

> Three "lacks," accordingly, explain such a sad destiny of the productive associations:  
> 
> a) the lack of capital,  
> b) the lack of successful marketing, and  
> c) the lack of discipline

> Therefore, for the purposes of economic analysis, the productive association may be taken, in the words of Fuchs, only as being in its statu nascendi.

> The cooperative associations of consumers are inherently profitless, Dr. Fuchs says further, while the productive associations, being acquisitive enterprises" (Erwerbsunternehmungen), work for profit, as do other enterprises. The most essential economic feature of the productive cooperative association is that all its owners are employed by the association and all its employees are its owners. If some of the members (owners) of the association do not actually work and remain its shareholders only, or if, on the other hand, not all the persons working for the association are its regular members (owners), but some of them are only wage earners, then, Dr. Fuchs says, there is not any real economic difference between such an association and a regular stock company. The productive cooperative associations, like every other enterprise under certain conditions, has a definite optimum volume of employment and hence cannot be based, obviously, on the principle of unlimited membership: it is, therefore, of necessity, a cooperative with closed membership.
