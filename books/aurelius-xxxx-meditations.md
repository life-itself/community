title: Meditations by Marcus Aurelius
---
Thoughts and commentary on Marcus Aurelius' Meditations in the Hays translation.

## Key themes

- Vanity of all worldly things -- you are going to die (and could do so at any moment), fame dies too etc etc.
- The Path of virtue/wisdom: e.g. justice, honesty, self-control, courage, a mind satisfied that it has succeeded in enabling you to act rationally, and satisfied to accept what’s beyond its control
- Which is the only thing worth pursuing. The only true guide in a fleeting world
- Some connection to a semi transcendental conception of reason/spirit "logos"

For example from Book 5:

> 23\. Keep in mind how fast things pass by and are gone—those that are now, and those to come. Existence flows past us like a river: the “what” is in constant flux, the “why” has a thousand variations. Nothing is stable, not even what’s right here. The infinity of past and future gapes before us—a chasm whose depths we cannot see.
> 
> So it would take an idiot to feel self-importance or distress. Or any indignation, either. As if the things that irritate us lasted.
> 
> 24\. Remember:
> 
> Matter. How tiny your share of it.
> Time. How brief and fleeting your allotment of it.
> Fate. How small a role you play in it.

From Book 4

> 6\. If, at some point in your life, you should come across anything better than justice, honesty, self-control, courage—than a mind satisfied that it has succeeded in enabling you to act rationally, and satisfied to accept what’s beyond its control—if you find anything better than that, embrace it without reservations—it must be an extraordinary thing indeed—and enjoy it to the full.


## Reflections 2022-05-30

Much wisdom.

Curious lack of joy. A lot of lecturing himself to endure and stay faithful to his principles. The hectoring tone, with a harshness. There is little of the self compassion and loving acceptance of Buddhism or IFS!

For example ...

> 13. When you wake up, ask yourself: Does it make any difference to you if other people blame you for doing what’s right? It makes no difference

Or 

> 15. Only a short time left. Live as if you were alone—out in the wilderness. No difference between here and there: the city that you live in is the world. Let people see someone living naturally, and understand what that means. Let them kill him if they can’t stand it. (Better than living like this.)
>     
> 16. To stop talking about what the good man is like, and just be one.

And then, at moments he beautifully touches the infinite and its peace (though even there often by using our ego's tinyness to assault it):

> 17\. Continual awareness of all time and space, of the size and life span of the things around us. A grape seed in infinite space. A half twist of a corkscrew against eternity.


And then back to something close to emotional repression but which can also be transformative (the tough love of the [landmark] Forum, the assault on meaning making that can finally set us free - though with Aurelius that freedom seems rarely touched):

> 25\. When a slave runs away from his master, we call him a fugitive slave. But the law of nature is a master too, and to break it is to become a fugitive. To feel grief, anger or fear is to try to escape from something decreed by the ruler of all things, now or in the past or in the future. And that ruler is law, which governs what happens to each of us. To feel grief or anger or fear is to become a fugitive—a fugitive from justice.

This is classic memento mori or meditation on the graveyard beautifully, beautifully expressed:
  
> When you look at yourself, see any of the emperors. And the same with everyone else. Then let it hit you: Where are they now? Nowhere . . . or wherever.
> 
  That way you’ll see human life for what it is. Smoke. Nothing. Especially when you recall that once things alter they cease to exist through all the endless years to come.
>  
> Then why such turmoil? To live your brief life rightly, isn’t that enough?
>  
> The raw material you’re missing, the opportunities . . . ! What is any of this but training—training for your logos, in life observed accurately, scientifically.
>  
  So keep at it, until it’s fully digested. As a strong stomach digests whatever it eats. As a blazing fire takes whatever you throw on it, and makes it light and flame.

This powerful insight held with such force. And something just a little off. Like he was so close to liberation, just a hair's breadth away.

And can allow for fact that Aurelius was an emperor and was constantly dealing with the day to day, the administration, the slings and arrows etc.

And ... that colours his views. Ultimately he is not a contemplative and does not reap the joys and insight of that path. He is necessarily very worldly. He is very wise in that, and doing an incredible job at holding sight of this ethical and philosophical ideal and insight.

It is a good example of distinction of wisdom from awakening. Aurelius is definitely partly awake, however not like eg Buddha or other spiritual figure. There is a mental insight plus strong ethics, a good (mental) practice and a strong will. In short, it is stoicism!

And it exemplifies the strengths and limits of stoicism.

# Excerpts and Commentary

BTW this is all based on the Hays translation 

## Book 5

### Mind is the rule of the soul

> 26. The mind is the ruler of the soul. It should remain unstirred by agitations of the flesh—gentle and violent ones alike. Not mingling with them, but fencing itself off and keeping those feelings in their place. When they make their way into your thoughts, through the sympathetic link between mind and body, don’t try to resist the sensation. The sensation is natural. But don’t let the mind start in with judgments, calling it “good” or “bad.”

A lot of wisdom, inclining at end to signlessness.

And a danger of creating a dualistic separation of body mind as well as a repressive domination dynamic eg "mind is the ruler of the soul ... remain unstirred by agitations of the flesh".  This is a delicate line to walk.

### Stop complaining!

> 29. You can live here as you expect to live there.
> 
> And if they won’t let you, you can depart life now and forfeit nothing. If the smoke makes me cough, I can leave. What’s so hard about that?
>
> Until things reach that point, I’m free. No one can keep me from doing what I want. And I want what is proper to rational beings, living together.

### Memento mori and all is empty (and our grasping vanity)

> 33\. Soon you’ll be ashes, or bones. A mere name, at most—and even that is just a sound, an echo. The things we want in life are empty, stale, and trivial. Dogs snarling at each other. Quarreling children—laughing and then bursting into tears a moment later. Trust, shame, justice, truth—“gone from the earth and only found in heaven.”
>  
> Why are you still here? Sensory objects are shifting and unstable; our senses dim and easily deceived; the soul itself a decoction of the blood; fame in a world like this is worthless.
> 
> —And so?
>
> Wait for it patiently—annihilation or metamorphosis.
  —And until that time comes—what?
> 
> Honor and revere the gods, treat human beings as they deserve, be tolerant with others and strict with yourself. Remember, nothing belongs to you but your flesh and blood—and nothing else is under your control.

## Book 6

### Positive fatalism

Illustrative of tendency to positive fatalism. In tension with other points about signlessness. It is this attachment to finding coherence and meaning that stands in the way a little of "getting to the other shore" which lies on the other side of meaninglessness and emptiness. 

> 45. Whatever happens to you is for the good of the world. That would be enough right there. But if you look closely you’ll generally notice something else as well: whatever happens to a single person is for the good of others. (Good in the ordinary sense—as the world defines it.)

### Again Memento mori and foolishness of attachment to this brief candle followed by living rightfully is only meaningful thing

But why is that meaningful? Once we go down nihilism path why stop?

And so beautifully put!

> 47\. Keep this constantly in mind: that all sorts of people have died—all professions, all nationalities. Follow the thought all the way down to Philistion, Phoebus, and Origanion. Now extend it to other species. 
> 
  We have to go there too, where all of them have already gone:
> 
>  . . . the eloquent and the wise—Heraclitus, Pythagoras, Socrates . . .
>  . . . the heroes of old, the soldiers and kings who followed them . . .
>  . . . Eudoxus, Hipparchus, Archimedes . . .
>  . . . the smart, the generous, the hardworking, the cunning, the selfish . . .
>  . . . and even Menippus and his cohorts, who laughed at thewhole brief, fragile business.
> 
>  All underground for a long time now.
>  And what harm does it do them? Or the others either—the ones whose names we don’t even know?
>  The only thing that isn’t worthless: to live this life out truthfully and rightly. And be patient with those who don’t.

# Book VIII

### Mind as fortress

Something off for me about his direction and tendency. A hiding from life, from fullness of it. A creeping dualism. Yes, we may wish to transcend our passions, not to be given by them but cut them out, deny them this seems an unwise path.

> 48\. Remember that when it withdraws into itself and finds contentment there, the mind is invulnerable. It does nothing against its will, even if its resistance is irrational. And if its judgment is deliberate and grounded in logic . . . ?
> 
  The mind without passions is a fortress. No place is more secure. Once we take refuge there we are safe forever. Not to see this is ignorance. To see it and not seek safety means misery.

# Book 9
### Nature's design gives us morality 

Dubious of theories here. Does nature really have an innate justice. It depends on what we mean by nature I suppose.

> 1. Injustice is a kind of blasphemy. Nature designed rational beings for each other’s sake: to help—not harm—one another, as they deserve. To transgress its will, then, is to blaspheme against the oldest of the gods.

It continues:

> And to lie is to blaspheme against it too. Because “nature” means the nature of that which is. And that which is and that which is the case are closely linked, so that nature is synonymous with Truth—the source of all true things. To lie deliberately is to blaspheme—the liar commits deceit, and thus injustice. And likewise to lie without realizing it. Because the involuntary liar disrupts the harmony of nature—its order. He is in conflict with the way the world is structured. As anyone is who deviates toward what is opposed to the truth—even against his will. Nature gave him the resources to distinguish between true and false. And he neglected them, and now can’t tell the difference.
> 
> And to pursue pleasure as good, and flee from pain as evil—that too is blasphemous. Someone who does that is bound to find himself constantly reproaching nature—complaining that it doesn’t treat the good and bad as they deserve, but often lets the bad enjoy pleasure and the things that produce it, and makes the good suffer pain, and the things that produce pain. And moreover, to fear pain is to fear something that’s bound to happen, the world being what it is—and that again is blasphemy. While if you pursue pleasure, you can hardly avoid wrongdoing—which is manifestly blasphemous.

## 40 Early version of Pascal's wager

> 40\. Either the gods have power or they don’t. If they don’t, why pray? If they do, then why not pray for something else instead of for things to happen or not to happen? Pray not to feel fear. Or desire, or grief. If the gods can do anything, they can surely do that for us.

### 41 Concentrate on what you’re doing

> Not to let go of philosophy, no matter what happens; not to bandy words with crackpots and philistines—good rules for any philosopher.
>
> Concentrate on what you’re doing, and what you’re doing it with.

Sage advice and beautifully put especially that "not to bandy words with crackpots and philistines ..."
# Book 10
### 1. To my soul

So straight and authentic. And something of the zen liberation missing. There is a strivingness to stoicism, for Aurelius, a frustration with how he is in the mind. And a lack of ontological sophistication - still somewhat locked in the body-mind duality (or body mind logos).

> 1\. To my soul
> 
> Are you ever going to achieve goodness? Ever going to be simple, whole, and naked—as plain to see as the body that contains you? Know what an affectionate and loving disposition would feel like? Ever be fulfilled, ever stop desiring—lusting and longing for people and things to enjoy? Or for more time to enjoy them? Or for some other place or country—“a more temperate clime”? Or for people easier to get along with? And instead be satisfied with what you have, and accept the present—all of it. And convince yourself that everything is the gift of the gods, that things are good and always will be, whatever they decide and have in store for the preservation of that perfect entity—good and just and beautiful, creating all things, connecting and embracing them, and gathering in their separated fragments to create more like them.

### We are as leaves that the wind drives earthward

> 34\. If you’ve immersed yourself in the principles of truth, the briefest, most random reminder is enough to dispel all fear and pain:
>
>>  . . . leaves that the wind
>>  Drives earthward; such are the generations of men. [Homer, Iliad]
>
> Your children, leaves.
> 
> Leaves applauding loyally and heaping praise upon you, or turning around and calling down curses, sneering and mocking from a safe distance.
>
> A glorious reputation handed down by leaves.
>
> All of these “spring up in springtime”—and the wind blows them all away. And the tree puts forth others to replace them.
> 
> None of us have much time. And yet you act as if things were eternal—the way you fear and long for them. . . .
>
> Before long, darkness. And whoever buries you mourned in their turn.

What a glorious driving diatribe. A ruthless extermination of every illusion.

Note the connection with [[five remembrances]]. Yet note the harsher tone compared to Buddhism.

## Book 11

## Book 12

### 21 Impermanence of all things

[[Impermanence]] -- very very close to the Buddhist version. Though always with that harsh Stoic edge "before long you'll be no-one".

> 21\. That before long you’ll be no one, and nowhere. Like all the things you see now. All the people now living.
> 
> Everything’s destiny is to change, to be transformed, to perish. So that new things can be born.

### On god's and their existence

> 28\. People ask, “Have you ever seen the gods you worship? How can you be sure they exist?” Answers:
>
> i. Just look around you.
> ii. I’ve never seen my soul either. And yet I revere it.
> 
> That’s how I know the gods exist and why I revere them—from having felt their power, over and over.

## Introduction

### This context is powerful and moving

Even the "all powerful" Roman emperor at the height of its power has to deal with the constant slings and arrows of fortune.

> By 175 the Romans seemed to have gained the upper hand. But at this point disturbing news arrived. Avidius Cassius, who had distinguished himself as a general during the Parthian War and who as governor of Syria now served as virtual regent of the Eastern empire, had revolted and declared himself emperor. Some of the Eastern provinces (notably Cappadocia) remained loyal to Marcus, but Cassius was recognized as emperor throughout much of the East, and in particular in Egypt, whose grain supply was crucial to the capital. Civil war seemed inevitable, and was prevented only by Cassius’s assassination at the hands of a subordinate. Marcus was nevertheless obliged to travel east to reassert his authority, taking with him Faustina (who died in the course of the journey). He visited the major cities of the East, Antioch and Alexandria, arriving finally at Athens, where he was initiated into the Eleusinian Mysteries, a set of mystic rites connected with the worship of Demeter, the goddess of agriculture.
> 
> Now in his fifties, Marcus was in declining health, and the revolt of Cassius had only underlined the need to make arrangements for the succession. Faustina had borne at least thirteen children, many of whom had died young. By the mid-170s, Marcus had only one surviving son, Commodus, just entering his teens. There was no reason for Marcus to continue the policy of adoption followed by his predecessors, and there is no reason to think he even considered it. The years that follow see Commodus’s rapid promotion to a position not far short of co-emperor. He was consul in 177 at the age of fifteen. In the same year he was accorded all the major imperial privileges, except for the post of Pontifex Maximus, the head of the Roman state religion, held by the reigning emperor alone, and for life.
>  
> The gains of the Marcomannic Wars had not proved permanent, and in 178, Marcus and Commodus marched north again. Two years later Marcus died at age fifty-eight, the first emperor to pass on the throne to his son since Vespasian a century before. Sadly, Commodus’s performance did not bear out whatever promise Marcus had discerned in him. He was to be remembered as a dissolute tyrant, a second Caligula or Nero whose many defects were only emphasized by the contrast with his father. His assassination after a twelve-year reign would usher in the first in a series of power struggles that would burden the empire for the next century.
> 
> ...
> 
> The composition of the Meditations is normally dated to the 170s—Marcus’s last decade. That this was a dark and stressful period for him can hardly be doubted. In the ten years between 169 and 179 he had to cope with constant fighting on the frontier, the abortive revolt of Cassius, and the deaths of his colleague Verus; his wife, Faustina; and others. Though he could hardly have anticipated the century of turmoil that would follow his death, he may have suspected that his son and successor, Commodus, was not the man he hoped. That in these circumstances Marcus should have sought consolation in philosophy is only natural.

### Three disciplines of perception, action and will

Lot of commentary here. My use of term ontology would encompass the topics of metaphysics and ethics here. These are a good set of questions. Question of right view and the adding of meaning etc.

> The questions that the Meditations tries to answer are primarily metaphysical and ethical ones: **Why are we here? How should we live our lives? How can we ensure that we do what is right? How can we protect ourselves against the stresses and pressures of daily life? How should we deal with pain and misfortune? How can we live with the knowledge that someday we will no longer exist?** It would be both pointless and impertinent to try to summarize Marcus’s responses; the influence of the Meditations on later readers springs in part from the clarity and insistence with which he addresses these questions. It may be worthwhile, however, to draw attention to one pattern of thought that is central to the philosophy of the Meditations (as well as to Epictetus), and that has been identified and documented in detail by Pierre Hadot. This is the doctrine of the three “disciplines”: the disciplines of perception, of action and of the will.
> 
> The discipline of perception requires that we maintain absolute objectivity of thought: that we see things dispassionately for what they are. Proper understanding of this point requires a brief introduction to the Stoic theory of cognition. We have seen that for the Stoics universal order is represented by the logos. The logos infuses and is wielded by our hegemonikon (literally, “that which guides”), which is the intellective part of our consciousness. In different contexts it can approximate either “will” or “character” and it performs many of the functions that English speakers attribute to the brain or the heart.4 One of its primary functions is to process and assess the data we receive from our senses. At every instant the objects and events in the world around us bombard us with impressions. As they do so they produce a phantasia, a mental impression. From this the mind generates a perception (hypolepsis), which might best be compared to a print made from a photographic negative. Ideally this print will be an accurate and faithful representation of the original. But it may not be. It may be blurred, or it may include shadow images that distort or obscure the original.
> 
> Chief among these are inappropriate value judgments: the designation as “good” or “evil” of things that in fact are neither good nor evil. For example, my impression that my house has just burned down is simply that—an impression or report conveyed to me by my senses about an event in the outside world. By contrast, my perception that my house has burned down and I have thereby suffered a terrible tragedy includes not only an impression, but also an interpretation imposed upon that initial impression by my powers of hypolepsis. It is by no means the only possible interpretation, and I am not obliged to accept it. I may be a good deal better off if I decline to do so. It is, in other words, not objects and events but the interpretations we place on them that are the problem. Our duty is therefore to exercise stringent control over the faculty of perception, with the aim of protecting our mind from error.


# Excerpts and commentary II

For some reason I seem to have made annotations here in two places. Oh well. Most of this commentary is just on book 4.

### You could leave life right now, let that determine what you do and say and and think

> You could leave life right now. Let that determine what you do and say and think. If the gods exist, then to abandon human beings is not frightening; the gods would never subject you to harm. And if they don’t exist, or don’t care what happens to us, what would be the point of living in a world without gods or Providence? But they do exist, they do care what happens to us, and everything a person needs to avoid real harm they have placed within him. If there were anything harmful on the other side of death, they would have made sure that the ability to avoid it was within you.
  
Refs: [[Live present to death]].

Interesting to see the insistence that the gods exist -- and the assumption that without there is simple nihilism ("what would be the point in living ..."). Misses out 

👍

### Dualities and concepts are traps for the unwary mind

> But death and life, success and failure, pain and pleasure, wealth and poverty, all these happen to good and bad alike, and they are neither noble nor shameful—and hence neither good nor bad.
  
cf [[Ecclesiastes 9:11]]

> I returned and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favor to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all.

👍

### Embrace what is there in front of you right how, the life you, the present moment you are living

> Even if you’re going to live three thousand more years, or ten times that, remember: you cannot lose another life than the one you’re living now, or live another one than the one you’re losing. The longest amounts to the same as the shortest. The present is the same for everyone; its loss is the same for everyone; and it should be clear that a brief instant is all that is lost. For you can’t lose either the past or the future; how could you lose what you don’t have? Remember two things:
> 
  i. that everything has always been the same, and keeps recurring, and it makes no difference whether you see the same things recur in a hundred years or two hundred, or in an infinite period;
>  
>  ii. that the longest-lived and those who will die soonest lose the same thing. The present is all that they can give up, since that is all you have, and what you do not have, you cannot lose."
  
Very [[Zen]]. To a great degree, Stoicism is the Western philosophy  closest to Zen.

### Follow the rule and law of the most ancient communities and states

> But the goal of rational beings is to follow the rule and law of the most ancient of communities and states.
  
🚩 this an example of a moment where Aurelius veers from the transcendent back into the more conventional worldview of his time. You could try interpreting this in say a Tao-ist way (following the most ancient law) but i think that is a stretch.

### 

> So we need to hurry. Not just because we move daily closer to death but also because our understanding—our grasp of the world—may be gone before we get there."
  
Strong sense here of some "attachment" / "grasping". Why do we need to hurry?

Lack of [[aimlessness]] (3rd door of Liberation)

### Don't be afraid of change ...

> If it doesn’t hurt the individual elements to change continually into one another, why are people afraid of all of them changing and separating? It’s a natural thing. And nothing natural is evil.
  
Good point and yet the decent into signlessness at the very end after being close to going beyond. There is no meaning, no true concepts.

### Accept death: it comes for all us, however wise 

> Hippocrates cured many illnesses—and then fell ill and died. The Chaldaeans predicted the deaths of many others; in due course their own hour arrived. Alexander, Pompey, Caesar—who utterly destroyed so many cities, cut down so many thousand foot and horse in battle—they too departed this life. Heraclitus often told us the world would end in fire. But it was moisture that carried him off; he died smeared with cowshit. Democritus was killed by ordinary vermin, Socrates by the human kind.
>
> And?
> 
> You boarded, you set sail, you’ve made the passage. Time to disembark. If it’s for another life, well, there’s nowhere without gods on that side either. If to nothingness, then you no longer have to put up with pain and pleasure, or go on dancing attendance on this battered crate, your body—so much inferior to that which serves it.
> 
> One is mind and spirit, the other earth and garbage."
  
A beautiful passage ... and it descends into to the kind of cheap dualistic body hating that is the disfigurement of so much platonic-christian thought. We are our bodies just as much (and just as little) as we are our minds.

### Don't worry about what other people say, or do or think

> Someone like that—someone who refuses to put off joining the elect—is a kind of priest, a servant of the gods, in touch with what is within him and what keeps a person undefiled by pleasures, invulnerable to any pain, untouched by arrogance, unaffected by meanness, an athlete in the greatest of all contests—the struggle not to be overwhelmed by anything that happens. With what leaves us dyed indelibly by justice, welcoming wholeheartedly whatever comes—whatever we’re assigned—not worrying too often, or with any selfish motive, about what other people say. Or do, or think."

### Lists the virtues: justice, honesty, self-control, courage, a mind satisfied that it has succeeded in enabling you to act rationally, and satisfied to accept what’s beyond its control

> 6\. If, at some point in your life, you should come across anything better than justice, honesty, self-control, courage—than a mind satisfied that it has succeeded in enabling you to act rationally, and satisfied to accept what’s beyond its control—if you find anything better than that, embrace it without reservations—it must be an extraordinary thing indeed—and enjoy it to the full.
> 
> But if nothing presents itself that’s superior to the spirit that lives within—the one that has subordinated individual desires to itself, that discriminates among impressions, that has broken free of physical temptations (as Socrates used to say), and subordinated itself to the gods, and looks out for human beings’ welfare—if you find that there’s nothing more important or valuable than that . . .
>  
>  . . . then don’t make room for anything but it—for anything that might lead you astray, tempt you off the road, and leave you unable to devote yourself completely to achieving the goodness that is uniquely yours. It would be wrong for anything to stand between you and attaining goodness—as a rational being and a citizen. Anything at all: the applause of the crowd, high office, wealth, or self-indulgence. All of them might seem to be compatible with it—for a while. But suddenly they control us and sweep us away.
>  
>  So make your choice straightforwardly, once and for all, and stick to it. Choose what’s best."
  
👍👍

The last part echoes the warnings against fame, wealth, sensuality in buddhism. The three temptations.

### The span we live is small

> 10\. Forget everything else. Keep hold of this alone and remember it: Each of us lives only now, this brief instant. The rest has been lived already, or is impossible to see. The span we live is small—small as the corner of the earth in which we live it. Small as even the greatest renown, passed from mouth to mouth by short-lived stick figures, ignorant alike of themselves and those long dead."
  

Ruthless honesty and insight becomes bleakness when unleavened with insight.

Close to zen and yet a fingers breadth separate and that distance is a thousand miles.

### Turn obstacles into fuel and burn higher from it

> Our inward power, when it obeys nature, reacts to events by accommodating itself to what it faces—to what is possible. It needs no specific material. It pursues its own aims as circumstances allow; it turns obstacles into fuel. As a fire overwhelms what would have quenched a lamp. What’s thrown on top of the conflagration is absorbed, consumed by it—and makes it burn still higher."
  
Beautiful metaphor

## Book 4

### Looking deeply into our impermanence and see that things have no hold on the soul

> Or is it your reputation that’s bothering you? But look at how soon we’re all forgotten. The abyss of endless time that swallows it all. The emptiness of all those applauding hands. The people who praise us—how capricious they are, how arbitrary. And the tiny region in which it all takes place. The whole earth a point in space—and most of it uninhabited. How many people there will be to admire you, and who they are.
> 
> So keep this refuge in mind: the back roads of your self. Above all, no strain and no stress. Be straightforward. Look at things like a man, like a human being, like a citizen, like a mortal. And among the things you turn to, these two:
>
> i. That things have no hold on the soul. They stand there unmoving, outside it. Disturbance comes only from within—from our own perceptions.
> ii. That everything you see will soon alter and cease to exist. Think of how many changes you’ve already seen.
>
>> "The world is nothing but change. Our life is only perception." [Democritus fragment B115]

This is Stoicism coming very close to Buddhism.

👍👍

### Waves and water

> You have functioned as a part of something; you will vanish into what produced you.
> 
> Or be restored, rather.
> To the logos from which all things spring.
> By being changed.
>
> 15. Many lumps of incense on the same altar. One crumbles now, one later, but it makes no difference."
  
Very zen. Waves and water.

What is logos? Has a deep history.

### Immortality through fame is also empty - who was the seventh most famous mayan? 

> People who are excited by posthumous fame forget that the people who remember them will soon die too. And those after them in turn. Until their memory, passed from one to another like a candle flame, gutters and goes out.
> 
> But suppose that those who remembered you were immortal and your memory undying. What good would it do you? And I don’t just mean when you’re dead, but in your own lifetime. What use is praise, except to make your lifestyle a little more comfortable?"

### Genuine beauty needs no praise

> Does anything genuinely beautiful need supplementing? No more than justice does—or truth, or kindness, or humility. Are any of those improved by being praised? Or damaged by contempt? Is an emerald suddenly flawed if no one admires it? Or gold, or ivory, or purple? Lyres? Knives? Flowers? Bushes?"

Yes ... and the point of appreciation is not to add to the beauty but to build consensus on beauty amongst people.

### If you seek tranquillity, do less

> “If you seek tranquillity, do less.” Or (more accurately) do what’s essential—what the logos of a social being requires, and in the requisite way. Which brings a double satisfaction: to do less, better.
> 
> Because most of what we say and do is not essential. If you can eliminate it, you’ll have more time, and more tranquillity. Ask yourself at every moment, “Is this necessary?”
>
> But we need to eliminate unnecessary assumptions as well. To eliminate the unnecessary actions that follow."

### All is vanity, everything passes ... so pursue the logos and virtue

> The age of Vespasian, for example. People doing the exact same things: marrying, raising children, getting sick, dying, waging war, throwing parties, doing business, farming, flattering, boasting, distrusting, plotting, hoping others will die, complaining about their own lives, falling in love, putting away money, seeking high office and power.
> 
> And that life they led is nowhere to be found.
> 
> Or the age of Trajan. The exact same things. And that life too—gone.
> 
> Survey the records of other eras. And see how many others gave their all and soon died and decomposed into the elements that formed them."   

All is vanity. With a get out for following the logos. For being virtuous.

Wisdom is consistent. Do not get attached. Do not chase worldly things. Yet we do, so constantly.

### Proportion attentiveness to the object. Do not give small things more time than they deserve 

> A key point to bear in mind: The value of attentiveness varies in proportion to its object. You’re better off not giving the small things more time than they deserve."

Nicely put. And very much a business-person's (or an emperor's) maxim. Not that of say a zen master - give full attention to everything!

### Everything fades (so quickly). Ignore fame, pursue virtue

>  Everything fades so quickly, turns into legend, and soon oblivion covers it.
>  
>  And those are the ones who shone. The rest—“unknown, unasked-for” a minute after death. What is “eternal” fame? Emptiness.
>  Then what should we work for?
>  
>  Only this: proper understanding; unselfish action; truthful speech. A resolve to accept whatever happens as necessary and familiar, flowing like water from that same source and spring"


The question, of course, for the nihilist is why even the virtues? Why is *anything* worth pursuing. There is an answer and it is one it took me half a lifetime to find.

Aurelius' answer seems closer to the modern existentialists: there is no answer, we simply choose. But it is a very thin gruel to live on -- and one senses that thin-ness at many moments in the meditations.

### Wisdom is justice

> On the verge of dying and still weighed down, still turbulent, still convinced external things can harm you, still rude to other people, still not acknowledging the truth: that wisdom is justice.

[[Wisdom]] is justice.

This constant ruthless honesty before the mirror of life is what touches one so deeply, what has this speak across the centuries, what brings this work alive.

### Be tough: You can keep quiet even if the body you are attached to is stabbed or burnt

> In your capacity to see it. Stop doing that and everything will be fine. Let the part of you that makes that judgment keep quiet even if the body it’s attached to is stabbed or burnt, or stinking with pus, or consumed by cancer. Or to put it another way: It needs to realize that what happens to everyone—bad and good alike—is neither good nor bad. That what happens in every life—lived naturally or not—is neither natural nor unnatural."   

This is the point where stoicism is closest to signlessness and seeing the distinction (so crucial to Buddhism) between pain and suffering -- one physical or emotional fact, the other the reaction to that fact which "we" get to choose.

Yet also in danger of veering into the ditch of simple repression, of stoicism in its common usage of endurance in the face of physical or emotional pain.

### Human lives are brief and trivial

>   "In short, know this: Human lives are brief and trivial. Yesterday a blob of semen; tomorrow embalming fluid, ash."


Meditation on the graveyard. Memento mori.

### The world as living being: one nature, one soul

> 40\. The world as a living being—one nature, one soul. Keep that in mind. And how everything feeds into that single experience, moves with a single motion. And how everything helps produce everything else. Spun and woven together."

Interwoven. [[Interbeing]]. 

### Be like an olive that ripens and falls praising its mother and thanking the tree it grew on

> To pass through this brief life as nature demands. To give it up without complaint.
> 
> Like an olive that ripens and falls.
>  
> Praising its mother, thanking the tree it grew on.
>  
> 49\. To be like the rock that the waves keep crashing over. It stands unmoved and the raging of the sea falls still around it."

Beautifully put. 🌷

### Take the shortest route

>   "51. Take the shortest route, the one that nature planned—to speak and act in the healthiest way. Do that, and be free of pain and stress, free of all calculation and pretension."

[[Examples of wisdom]]

## Book 5

### Our lifetimes are so brief

> Our lifetime is so brief. And to live it out in these circumstances, among these people, in this body? Nothing to get excited about. Consider the abyss of time past, the infinite future. Three days of life or three generations: what’s the difference?"

Beautifully and honestly put. and with tendencies to the harsh nihilism -- "wake up and smell the coffee boy, you're nothing, nobody, you'll end up in the ground with dirt on your face" (and nothing more than that). This is the half-way or the half-part of Zen nothingness without the sudden realization of what lies on other other side of that.

### Stoicism as quietism

> No nature would do that—bring something about that wasn’t beneficial to what it governed."

There's a fine line between "accepting what is" and a false teleology that sees purpose where none is like we see faces in the clouds. Zen does a pretty good job if steering clear of this trap. What is, is. And that's it. There is no unfolding purpose, no grand plan of nature, or the kosmos or anything else. (Or perhaps there is 😉 ... but that's for another day)

### Impermanence and interbeing - we are a constant woven unfolding

> 13\. I am made up of substance and what animates it, and neither one can ever stop existing, any more than it began to. Every portion of me will be reassigned as another portion of the world, and that in turn transformed into another. Ad infinitum.
>  I was produced through one such transformation, and my parents too, and so on back. Ad infinitum.
>  
> N.B.: Still holds good, even if the world goes through recurrent cycles."

Another major theme. Form and substance in a constant unfolding. The question remains of the continuity of form (or not). Theseus' ship, cloud never dies etc. At very least, Aurelius is a strong non essentialist. Again another strong resonance with buddhism.

### Things gravitate toward what they were intended for

> "ii. Things gravitate toward what they were intended for.
> 
>  What things gravitate toward is their goal.
>  
>  A thing’s goal is what benefits it—its good.
>  
>  A rational being’s good is unselfishness. What we were born for. That’s nothing new. Remember? Lower things for the sake of higher ones, and higher ones for one another. Things that have consciousness are higher than those that don’t. And those with the logos still higher."

This is the slightly metaphysical mystical part that seems less convincing to me. (Very Aristotelian). Again an unwarranted teleology creeping in.

### Endurance as a virtue, as a part of wisdom

> 18\. Nothing happens to anyone that he can’t endure. The same thing happens to other people, and they weather it unharmed—out of sheer obliviousness or because they want to display “character.” Is wisdom really so much weaker than ignorance and vanity?"

Wisdom as endurance ... ie stoicism in the common meaning: dignified endurance in the face of the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune. 

### What stands in the way becomes the way

> What stands in the way becomes the way.

End of item 20. Book 5. That's a book title right there. [[abc/aphorisms|aphorisms]]

### All things change. Existence flows past us like a river

> 23\. Keep in mind how fast things pass by and are gone—those that are now, and those to come. Existence flows past us like a river: the “what” is in constant flux, the “why” has a thousand variations. Nothing is stable, not even what’s right here. The infinity of past and future gapes before us—a chasm whose depths we cannot see.
> 
> So it would take an idiot to feel self-importance or distress. Or any indignation, either. As if the things that irritate us lasted.
> 
> 24\. Remember:
> 
> Matter. How tiny your share of it.
> Time. How brief and fleeting your allotment of it.
> Fate. How small a role you play in it.

Insignificance. Vanity. Freedom that comes from embracing that.
