### Webbs on why [[abc/worker-coops]] don't work: either fail or starting hiring non-members and cease to be democracies

> A negative judgment on worker cooperatives was first rendered early in this century by the prestigious social scientists Beatrice and Sidney Webb. Their verdict has been the conventional wisdom ever since:
>
> > All such associations of producers that start as alternatives to the capitalist system either fail or cease to be democracies of producers….
> >
> > In the relatively few instances in which such enterprises have not succumbed as business concerns, they have ceased to be democracies of producers, managing their own work, and have become, in effect, associations of capitalists…making profit for themselves by the employment at wages of workers outside their association.

## 2. The Basques

### The egalitarian and democratic origins of Basque culture: between ~1300 to at least 1600 (male) democracy in major parts of Basque country

Key points

- Starting at least in medieval period 700-800y ago Basque had a lot of autonomy and a lot equality. By 15th century Basques in region of Guipuzcoa had been declared _hijosdalgos_ i.e. "sons of "something" (i.e. noble or of noble descent) and hence free.
- Basques were equal among themselves and this was expressed in democracy.
- e.g. in 16th/17th centuries every male head of household in Guipuzcoa and Vizcaya could vote for municipal government.
- Codified common law into "fueros": laws to govern and administer the provinces as autonomous units.
- Lives on strongly in folk memory


> The region developed autonomously until the political consolidation of the nation during the reign of Ferdinand and Isabella in the fifteenth century. The history of the region since then must be seen against a background of struggle by local leaders to preserve their autonomy and the efforts of the Crown first to accommodate that autonomy and then to suppress it.
> 
> The Basques took advantage of the political struggles of the kings of Navarre and Castile against the feudal lords in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. Up to this time, allied with the King of Aragon, the lords had controlled the countryside, and fighting among them had retarded the growth of commerce.
> 
> In their struggle against the King of Aragon and the feudal lords, the kings of Navarre, and later Castile, encouraged the growth of urban centers. To migrants to the towns and cities, the Castilian Crown offered freedom from the serfdom owed to feudal lords. The monarchs saw freeing the townspeople from the control of the feudal lords as a means of extending central control, whereas the Basques saw it as enhancing opportunities for local autonomy.
> 
> This struggle for autonomy was supported by the development of a distinctive Basque myth. By the fifteenth century, the Basques had persuaded the Spanish king to declare all inhabitants of Guipuzcoa _hijosdalgos_ (people of known parentage or, literally, “sons of something”) and thus “noble” and “equal” in relation to each other. (_Hidalgo_, a shortened form of the word, was a title given in Spain to members of the minor nobility.) Ironically, the myth did not base egalitarian claims on the virtues of the common man but rather on the comforting fiction that, because they were all of noble blood, Basques were equal among themselves and superior to other peoples.
> 
> Democratic local governments expressed the egalitarian spirit. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, every male head of a family was entitled to vote for members of the municipal government, and in Guipuzcoa and Vizcaya municipalities elected representatives to a provincial government. The general assemblies in these two provinces codified the common law into what were called _fueros_ (laws to govern and administer the provinces as autonomous units). As the bases for local democracy, the _fueros_ are looked on with nostalgia by many Basques. From the seventeenth century on, the Spanish Crown withdrew much of its support of local autonomy and restricted the right to vote in municipal elections to those who met a wealth requirement, thus halving the number of voters.

### Also extensive artisanal guilds with extensive mutual aid

Basque members of skilled crafts and professions struggled to maintain their values of equality and democracy within their occupational associations, while seeking to gain monopolies on their particular economic activities. The rising power of the merchants, who needed free trade and cheap labor for mines and factories, undermined the preexisting restrictions on immigration and also the monopolies on crafts and professions. In rural areas, families expressed their sense of equality and social solidarity by joining together to exchange labor and mutual aid.

The Basque guilds were health and welfare organizations, as well as units of production. They protected their workers and helped orphans and widows. They opened hospitals and sanitariums. They formed networks of skilled workers, which bid for jobs, distributed the work among the guilds, and delivered the finished products.

The guilds were characterized by strong internal solidarity but were closed to outsiders. Although the guilds lost their monopoly powers when large industry developed, the guild tradition survived in the region. Some of the largest guilds, such as those of firearms producers, formed producers’ cooperatives in the twentieth century. This form of organization found acceptance among the small industries in the interior of the region—and indeed in other parts of Spain as well. In 1972, there were 193 registered producers’ cooperatives in the Basque country (Gorroho 1975). Of these, 144 were independent of the Mondragón complex.
