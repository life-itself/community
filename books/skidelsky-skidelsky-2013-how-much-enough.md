### The question

The title question “How Much is Enough?” is, in fact, a lead in to a
more fundamental question: “How Much for What?” to which the answer is
to “Live the Good Life”. The book’s main purpose therefore to answer the
more basic question “What is the Good Life?” — rather than its title.

> “The purpose of this book is to persuade the reader that such a
> thing—the good life—does exist and can be known, and that we ought to
> strive to live it. How much money we need to live it comes at the end
> of the argument, not at the beginning.” \[Preface\]

### The answer

The “Good Life consists in realising the following “basic goods” (or
ultimate goods or end-values) (see [*spreadsheet with
comparison*](http://drive.google.com/open?id=1ovCln-ZZyNSbH-l-L65REcbb9O9WjBb6D7hp4-31xdw)),
as set out in *Chapter 6: Elements of the Good Life*:

-   *Health*. By health we mean the full functioning of the body, the
    > perfection of our animal nature. Health includes all things needed
    > to sustain life, or a reasonable span of life, but is by no means
    > limited to them.

-   *Security*. By security we mean an individual’s justified
    > expectation that his life will continue more or less in its
    > accustomed course, undisturbed by war, crime, revolution or major
    > social and economic upheavals.

-   *Respect*. To respect someone is to indicate, by some formality or
    > otherwise, that one regards his views and interests as worthy of
    > consideration, as things not to be ignored or trampled on.

-   *Personality*. By personality we mean first of all the ability to
    > frame and execute a plan of life reflective of one’s tastes,
    > temperament and conception of the good.

-   *Harmony with Nature*. TODO - not that clearly defined by them ...

-   *Friendship*. This is a necessarily inadequate translation of the
    > ancient Greek philia, a term encompassing all robust,
    > affectionate relationships. A father, spouse, teacher and workmate
    > might all be “friends” in our sense of the term.

-   *Leisure*. Leisure is that which we do for its own sake, not as a
    > means to something else. This contrasts with contemporary use
    > where leisure is synonymous with relaxation and rest. But leisure
    > is not just time off work but a special form of activity in its
    > own right.

### Lead-in and Background

Chapters one to five:

-   establish that there is a problem (and why was Keynes wrong that
    > everything would be great by now)

-   some of the causes of that problem (in the nature of capitalism).
    > Their critique of modern capitalism.

-   Critique alternative critiques of capitalism and their solutions:
    > “Before outlining our vision of the good life, we must look at a
    > couple of other influential attempts to halt the
    > growth juggernaut. The first appeals to the concept of happiness,
    > the second to that of sustainability. We are in sympathy with the
    > goals of both movements, but believe they mislocate the real basis
    > of our objection to endless growth, which is ethical, not
    > utilitarian.”

    -   “Happiness” — still lacks sensible ends (“happiness is not a
        > well-defined or good end in itself), still obsseses over more
        > (“happier, fitter”)

    -   (Deep) Ecology / Sustainability: either has no clear set of
        > alternative ends — “sustainability” — or, the ends are
        > unconvincing — “deep ecology”. Simple sustainability is a
        > utilitarian argument: we are using too much now to
        > be sustainable. Deep ecology is a fairly muddy set of ideas
        > around the inherent value of animals and nature. This may be
        > important but it is insufficient in itself as a powerful
        > vision of the good life.

-   Distinguish “good life” from hedonism - and the happiness obsession.
    > \[ed: This is a sensible distinction in my opinion\]

### Critique of Capitalism

*Comment: they argue (rightly) that the very fact of setting out these
values and implicitly arguing for their universal validity is important
— and radical (irrespective of whether their precise set of values is
perfectly correct). Modern capitalism has increasingly got trapped in a
false relativistic mindset other based by the following erroneous
assumptions:*

-   *Relativism - “de gustibus non est disputandam”, “chacun a son
    > gout”, “each to their own taste”*

-   *Hedonism - a focus on pleasure or happiness (a confusion of hedonia
    > with eudaimonia)*

-   *Insatiability (“more is always better”)*

-   *\[together\] =&gt; Individualistic hedonistic libertarian
    > relativisim*

An aside on growth: “Where does all this leave *growth*? Obviously no
sane policy has growth itself as a final end.”

-   "First, growth might sensibly be pursued as a *means* to one or more
    > of the basic goods."

-   "Second, **growth might interest us as an *index* of something else
    > we value**. … growth “should not be considered the *objective* of
    > economic policy, but rather the highly likely outcome … of two
    > things desirable in themselves—economic freedom to make choices,
    > and a spirit of continual enquiry and desire for change.”

## Evaluation

A tight, well-written, and well-argued book on an important topic.

-   TODO: Would be interesting to track down responses in media — would
    > give a flavour of attitudes out there.

-   TODO: would be interesting to start doing surveys amongst people on
    > end-values just like e.g. Schwarz is doing on behaviour-values.

### What was missing?** **What could be improved?

-   A stronger sense of why we have ended up here —- and the strategy
    > for getting to this place. These ideas are not that novel … “if
    > you’re so right, why aren’t more people in agreement”. This would
    > include:

    -   Psychological traps (see below)

    -   Collective action traps. People are embedded in a network of
        > social relations and financial relations. If everyone were to
        > opt out it would work but if I just do so i may face problems
        > (including access to goods like housing — if everyone stays in
        > the rat race I may find myself priced out)

-   Little or no awareness of Buddhist thought or mindfulness as
    > a practice. Buddhism mentioned just 3 times in main text and then
    > only in passing e.g.

    -   “Buddhism is usually counted as the third traditional teaching
        > of China, but in terms of its influence on the culture at
        > large, it can be grouped together with Taoism.” \[not even
        > accurate\]

    -   \[Buddhism largely subsumed under Hinduism\]“the Hindu
        > scriptures urge us to extinguish it altogether. “He who is
        > without desire, who is freed from desire …—he goes to
        > Brahma.”^*17*^ This ideal, better known to us under its
        > Buddhist name of nirvana, bears some resemblance to the Stoic
        > concept of apatheia or tranquillity, but is otherwise without
        > parallel in the West.”

-   A lack of consideration for the psychological factors. Getting in
    > caught in the treadmill of capitalistic growth may be due largely
    > to strong psychological features (acquisitiveness, competition,
    > individualistic and dualistic ways of thinking). We have to ask
    > why we don’t pursue the ideals they set out — they aren’t, after
    > all, entirely novel. I would argue that a big part of the answer
    > to that is our own erroneous cognitive and behavioural patterns —
    > and that mindful (Buddhist) ontology and practice are central to
    > addressing those errors.

## Excerpts

### Preface

> In a previous book, Robert Skidelsky did venture to name a sum that
> the economist John Maynard Keynes would have considered “enough” to
> satisfy *average* needs: £40,000 or \$66,000 or €46,000 a year (in
> today’s money). See Robert Skidelsky, *Keynes: The Return of the
> Master*, 2nd edn. (London: Penguin, 2010), p. 142, which also reveals
> the basis of the calculation. But Keynes was assuming a more settled
> idea of what the good life was than is now true, and less pressure to
> lead a bad life than now exists.

TODO: check the reference and the details of the calculation of this
number in the referenced book

### Critique of insatiability and capitalism

Introduction - p.1

> This book is an argument against insatiability, against that
> psychological disposition that prevents us, as individuals and as
> societies, from saying “enough is enough.” It is directed at economic
> insatiability, the desire for more and more money. It is chiefly
> directed at the rich parts of the world, which may be reasonably
> thought to have enough wealth for a decent collective life. For the
> poor parts of the world, where the mass of the people still live in
> great poverty, insatiability is a problem for the future. But in rich
> and poor societies alike, insatiability can be seen wherever the
> opulence of the very rich runs wildly ahead of the means of existence
> of the many.
>
> Marxists contend that economic insatiability is a creation of
> capitalism, which will disappear with its abolition. Christians argue
> that it is the product of original sin. Our own view is that it is
> rooted in human nature—in the disposition to compare our fortune with
> that of our fellows and find it wanting—but has been greatly
> intensified by capitalism, which has made it the psychological basis
> of an entire civilization. What was once an aberration of the rich is
> now a commonplace of everyday life.
>
> Capitalism is a two-edged sword. On the one hand, it has made possible
> vast improvements in material conditions. On the other, it has exalted
> some of the most reviled human characteristics, such as greed, envy
> and avarice. Our call is to chain up the monster again by recalling
> what the greatest thinkers of all times and all civilizations have
> meant by the “good life” and suggesting changes in current policy to
> help us achieve it.
>
> In doing this, we will be challenging the current obsession with the
> growth of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as the chief goal of economic
> policy. We are not against economic growth as such, but we may
> reasonably ask not just growth *for* what, but growth *of* what. We
> want leisure to grow and pollution to decline. Both are part of any
> sane idea of human welfare. But both are excluded from GDP, which
> measures only that portion of domestic production that is traded in
> markets. There is no subtraction for pollution, and no addition for
> leisure. The extent to which further GDP growth will improve welfare
> is therefore moot. It surely does so for very poor countries, but it
> may be the case that rich societies already have *too much* GDP.

…

> First, he asked something hardly discussed today: what is wealth for?
> How much money do we need to lead a good life? This might seem an
> impossible question. But it is not a trivial one. Making money cannot
> be an end in itself—at least for anyone not suffering from acute
> mental disorder. To say that my purpose in life is to make more and
> more money is like saying that my aim in eating is to get fatter and
> fatter. And what is true of individuals is also true of societies.

Aside: What is wrong with capitalism \[ed: our comments more than
authors\]

-   It does not have base values

-   It ends up substituting its own “non-well” ways of behaving for
    > these values — i.e. greed, envy, accumulativeness etc

-   Note: humans like to compare themselves — so they tend to like
    > metrics that allow for comparison. Capitalism hooks into that
    > big time.

Aside: Notes about environmental point:

-   Environmental “capital” is undermeasured — and under-priced

-   Evidence that we have a problem - and that we mismeasure “growth” if
    > we use GDP

### Chapter 6: Elements of a Good Life

First, what are useful criteria for “basic goods”? They are:

-   Universal …

-   Final — not just a means to some other good.

-   Sui-generis / largest category version of themselves. E.g. health vs
    > freedom from cancer. Former is the ultimate category for
    > the latter.

-   Indispensable: loss of them would be bad for *anyone*

Excerpt:

> An air of arbitrariness hangs over lists of basic goods, to dispel
> which we must make clear our criteria of inclusion. There are four:
>
> 1\. Basic goods are *universal*, meaning that they belong to the good
> life as such, not just some particular, local conception of it. To see
> the universal through the particular requires strong philosophical
> intuitions, guided by the testimony of different ages and cultures. This
> latter proviso is frequently forgotten. Too often, the “intuitions” of
> modern philosophers simply repeat the platitudes of early
> twenty-first-century liberalism. Nussbaum’s catalogue of central human
> capabilities includes, for example, “protection against discrimination
> on the basis of race, sex, sexual orientation, religion, caste,
> ethnicity, or national origin”—an impeccably progressive list, but
> hardly a universal one.^10^ A more philosophical caste of mind might
> question the equation of universal with modern liberal values. After
> all, from the standpoint of eternity, our own civilization is just as
> parochial as any other.
>
> 2\. Basic goods are *final*, meaning that that they are good in
> themselves, and not just as a means to some other good. (This
> distinguishes our basic goods from Rawls’s primary goods and from
> Nussbaum and Sen’s capabilities.) The standard philosopher’s way of
> uncovering final goods is to ask “what for?” over and over, like certain
> annoying small children. When no further answer is forthcoming, we know
> we have hit upon a final good. “What is that bicycle for?” “To get me to
> work.” “And what is work for?” “To make me money.” “And what is money
> for?” “To buy me food.” “And what is food for?” “To keep me alive.” “And
> what is life for?” Blank stare. Life is not “for” anything. In our
> terms, it is part of the basic good of health.
>
> All basic goods are final, but not all final goods are basic. An
> explanatory chain might conceivably come to an end with “in order to
> complete my collection of Soviet stamps.” Completing a stamp
> collection is a final good—it is not usually for the sake of anything
> else—but it is not basic, since it fails the test of both universality
> and indispensability, to be discussed in more detail below.
>
> **Many philosophers would want to add an additional last term to any
> given sequence of explanations, namely “in order to make me happy.” We
> think this is a mistake. Outside psychiatric clinics and philosophy
> seminars, people do not generally explain their actions by saying
> “this will make me happy.”** As we have already argued in Chapter 4,
> this is a strong reason not to treat happiness as the ultimate good.
>
> The requirement of finality rules out many goods that appear at first
> glance to be basic. Food, for instance, features in many traditional
> lists of basic goods, but as the above chain of questions shows, it is
> in fact instrumental to the basic good of life or health. Indulged in
> beyond this point, it ceases to be useful, and may even be harmful.
> (This is not to say that all spices and relishes superfluous to health
> are not good, just that they are not *basic* goods. We do not wish to
> reduce everyone to a diet of salad and tofu.) More relevantly to our
> theme, money cannot be a basic good, since it is essentially an
> instrument for obtaining other things. Other goods are more ambiguous.
> Health, security and leisure are on some accounts final, on others
> instrumental. We return to this issue below.
>
> 3\. Basic goods are *sui generis*, meaning that they are not part of some
> other good. The good of “freedom from cancer” is certainly universal and
> final, but not basic, because it can be subsumed under the larger good
> of health. Whether a good is *sui generis* or not is often hard to
> decide. For instance, family relationships, which we have included under
> the good of “friendship,” might be thought to merit a separate heading
> of their own. However, since what makes family and non-family
> relationships good is very much the same set of things—love, trust,
> stability—we decided that two categories would be superfluous.
>
> 4\. Basic goods are *indispensable*, meaning that anyone who lacks them
> may be deemed to have suffered a serious loss or harm. The qualification
> “anyone” is important. That missing, set-completing stamp might cause
> the stamp fanatic much genuine anguish, but this does not make a basic
> good. Nor need the loss or harm in question be perceived as such by its
> victim. Harms are frequently so taken for granted that they no longer
> register, but they are still harms.

### Seven Basic Goods

There are seven basic goods:

-   [*Health*](#kix.36nobtggvn5a)

-   [*Security*](#security)

-   Harmony with Nature

-   Friendship

-   Respect

-   Personality

-   Leisure

Comparison [*in a
table*](http://drive.google.com/open?id=1ovCln-ZZyNSbH-l-L65REcbb9O9WjBb6D7hp4-31xdw).

#### Health

> *Health*. By health we mean the full functioning of the body, the
> perfection of our animal nature. Health includes all things needed to
> sustain life, or a reasonable span of life, but is by no means limited
> to them. It implies vitality, energy, alertness and that ruddy beauty
> favored by Tolstoy and other moralists over more decadent ideals.
> Health is generally associated with absence of bodily pain, but its
> value is not purely utilitarian, for a comfortably ill person (on a
> morphine drip, say) is still worse off than a healthy one. Above all,
> health means a happy obliviousness of one’s own body, as of a tool
> perfectly fitted to its tasks. In the words of French physician René
> Leriche, it is “life lived in the silence of the organs.”^12^ Health
> looks outwards. Illness throws one back upon oneself.
>
> Many philosophers have ranked health lower than the other goods, on
> the grounds that it belongs to our animal as opposed to our
> distinctively human nature. “It is for the sake of the soul,” wrote
> Aristotle, setting the tone, “that … goods of the body are desirable
> at all, and all wise men ought to choose them for the sake of the
> soul, and not the soul for the sake of them.”^13^ If this is true,
> then health is not final in our sense, and so has no place on a list
> of basic human goods. But why deny health the status of a final end
> simply because animals can enjoy it too? Is that not just an
> intellectual’s prejudice? Our admiration of a young man’s vitality
> need not involve the further thought that it will help him walk to
> work, serve his country or whatever. We can admire it for its own
> sake, just as we do that of a playing dolphin or leopard cub.
>
> Today, health is the one good on which liberal states feel entitled to
> take a positive stance, for, unlike the goods of the soul, it carries
> the authority of science. But is there really a distinction here?
> Science can tell us whether drug *x* treats condition *y*, but not
> that condition *y* itself constitutes “ill-health.” This latter
> presupposes a pre-scientific, common-sense understanding of what it is
> for human beings to flourish. We all know a healthy baby when we see
> one, just as we all recognize blindness and lameness as disabilities.
> Other cases are more controversial. How fat does one have to be to
> count as overweight? How bodily capable to count as fit? Our answer to
> these questions will depend on what we think of the martial virtues,
> of sport, sex and much else besides. In short, judgments of health are
> objective in the same sense and to the same degree as ethical
> judgments: they too rest on an idea of human flourishing.
>
> Given this relationship, it is not surprising to find that the eclipse
> of teleological thinking in our culture has proceeded hand in hand
> with an unravelling of the concept of health. The process is similar
> to that we have already traced in connection with money. An earlier
> notion of health as being in “tip-top condition,” with everything
> “working as it should,” has given way to a new ideal of perpetual
> improvement. One symptom of this slippage is our obsession with
> longevity. Older medical traditions aimed to help individuals realize
> their natural lifespan; dying “of old age” was not deemed a calamity.
> But if there is no such thing as a natural lifespan, only a shifting,
> culturally relative norm, then death at *any* age can be seen as a
> regrettable and remediable failing. Modern science has rekindled the
> old alchemical promise of eternal youth; meanwhile, people who a few
> decades earlier would have died swiftly and relatively painlessly are
> kept alive in a state of chronic, debilitating sickness.^\*^
>
> Another symptom of this disorientation is the disappearance of any
> sharp distinction between *curing* the sick and *enhancing* the
> already healthy. Once the dividing-line was clear-cut: vital
> operations fell on one side, cosmetic improvements on the other. But
> if there is no such thing as perfect health, then *any* undesirable
> condition can be defined as illness and made an object of medical
> treatment. (And, as we saw in Chapter 1, there is no limit to the
> number of things that people can find undesirable.) This whole process
> is hastened along by the drugs companies, who have a strong interest
> in identifying the illnesses that their products will cure. The role
> of Pfizer, manufacturer of Viagra, in transforming what was once part
> and parcel of the human comedy into the fearsome new ailment of
> “erectile dysfunction” is a case in point.
>
> Ultimately, this assimilation of medicine to the economic rat race
> destroys the very idea of good health. If every state of the body can
> be seen as defective relative to some other, preferred state, then we
> are all in a sense perpetually ill. The world becomes, as Goethe said
> it would, a vast hospital, in which everyone is nurse to everyone
> else. What is more, where the demand for health is insatiable, medical
> costs expand in tandem with or faster than income, keeping us tethered
> to the work/growth treadmill. It is thus crucial to our purpose that
> health *not* be defined in this demand-relative sense, but retain the
> older meaning of the body’s natural perfection. For it is only in this
> sense that it can function as part of a criterion of enoughness.

#### Security

> *Security*. By security we mean an individual’s justified expectation
> that his life will continue more or less in its accustomed course,
> undisturbed by war, crime, revolution or major social and economic
> upheavals. Security is a necessary condition for the realization of
> other basic goods on our list, in particular personality, friendship
> and leisure. But it is also a good in itself. Like any creature, a
> human being has an environment, a set of taken-for-granted objects
> against which his life runs its course. If this environment is changed
> abruptly or frequently, he will feel perplexed and threatened, like a
> cat in a new house or a caged animal released into the wild. Of
> course, as intelligent beings, we have in us that which transcends any
> environment—which sees “the stars above the roof,” as the philosopher
> Josef Pieper puts it.^14^ Nonetheless, roofs and all that they imply
> are still necessary, not least as providing a stable location from
> which to gaze upon the stars. Across the world, the word “peace” has a
> soothing ring, while “turmoil,” “chaos” and their equivalents bode
> ill.
>
> To be sure, there are types—tyrants, speculators, romantic poets—who
> thrive on chaos. Chairman Mao, a tyrant and a romantic poet, loved
> chaos so much that he renamed it “permanent revolution.” In the West,
> security has so long been vilified by bohemian artists and
> intellectuals that admitting to a fondness for it now is almost like
> admitting to a fondness for garden gnomes. Yet the truth is that
> security is cherished by all creative spirits—including poets, when
> they are honest with themselves—as a condition of their own
> productivity. W. B. Yeats, writing in 1919, as Ireland descended into
> war, prayed that his young daughter would grow up to enjoy security:
>
> And may her bridegroom bring her to a house
>
> Where all’s accustomed, ceremonious;
>
> For arrogance and hatred are the wares
>
> Peddled in the thoroughfares.
>
> How but in custom and in ceremony
>
> Are innocence and beauty born?
>
> Ceremony’s a name for the rich horn,
>
> And custom for the spreading laurel tree.
>
> Yeats was not immune to the romanticism of disorder. He had written
> rapturously about the “terrible beauty” of the Easter 1916 uprising.
> Yet faced with real chaos, his choice was clear. He knew that extreme
> civil disorder is destructive of the arts of civilization.
>
> What are the effects of capitalism on security? Nineteenth-century
> liberals argued that *le doux commerce* would have a pacifying
> influence on international relations, since nations that traded with
> each other would have no good economic reasons to go to war. This
> argument has something to it, though of course trading nations can
> still go to war for bad economic or non-economic reasons, as they did
> in 1914. Internally, the effect of free markets on security is less
> salutary. “All that is solid melts into air,” wrote Marx famously,
> referring to the endless revolution of technologies, skills and ways
> of life under capitalism. This perpetual ripping up of the social
> fabric is wearisome for both workers and consumers. It is particularly
> taxing for those over the age of 40 or 50, who may have lost their
> taste for novelty. Free-market fundamentalists respond to such
> discontents with thinly veiled contempt. Those who cannot find work
> locally are urged to relocate, those whose talents have become
> redundant to “retool.” This is to get things precisely backwards. It
> is not human beings who need adapting to the market; it is the market
> that needs adapting to human beings. That was the guiding principle of
> the early twentieth-century social liberals, whose enlightened efforts
> to minimize the insecurities of capitalism have now largely been
> jettisoned, as we shall see in the next chapter.

#### Respect

> *Respect*. To respect someone is to indicate, by some formality or
> otherwise, that one regards his views and interests as worthy of
> consideration, as things not to be ignored or trampled on. Respect
> does not imply agreement or liking: one can respect an enemy. It does
> not imply any special admiration. But it does imply a certain
> recognition or “taking account” of the other’s point of view, an
> attitude fundamentally different from that shown towards animals. One
> can have great affection for a pet dog, but not respect or
> disrespect.^\*^
>
> Respect is a necessary condition of other basic goods, friendship in
> particular. But it is also a good in itself. Everywhere, slavery—that
> is, the complete withdrawal of respect—is regarded as a calamity
> second only to or worse than death. Indeed, as has often been said,
> slavery is a kind of social death, since the slave, though still human
> in the biological sense, has lost the *status* of a human being. “That
> look was not one between two men,” writes Primo Levi, a survivor of
> Auschwitz, recalling his cross-examination by a Nazi scientist.^15^
> Those exposed regularly to such looks soon come to assimilate their
> perspective. Self-respect cannot long survive the withdrawal of
> respect.
>
> Respect need not be equal or reciprocal. I can respect someone who
> respects me less or not at all. Nonetheless, reciprocal respect is
> uniquely satisfying to both parties, for our deepest wish is for the
> respect of those whom we ourselves respect. (The adoration of a
> sycophant or a mob leads more often to self-contempt than to
> self-respect.) In all ages, we find groups of “peers” or “equals”
> respecting each other while looking down on everyone else. The
> citizenry of ancient Athens was one such group, as was the medieval
> nobility. Modern democracy extends the circle of peers to all adults
> in a given territory. Whether or not its triumph is guaranteed by
> History, as Francis Fukuyama has claimed, it now has the support of
> almost all the world, at least on paper. No modern vision of the good
> life can be such as to thwart it. This rules out, as we noted in
> Chapter 3, values such as mastery and “greatness of soul,” which
> cannot in principle be universalized.
>
> Respect has many sources, varying from culture to culture. Strength,
> money, land, nobility, education and office have all figured
> prominently at one time or another. In modern bourgeois societies, the
> two basic sources of respect are civil rights and personal
> achievement. Civil rights confer what one might call “formal” respect;
> they guarantee their possessor protection against the worst forms of
> arbitrary power. But because they are bestowed on all citizens

#### Personality

> *Personality*. By personality we mean first of all the ability to
> frame and execute a plan of life reflective of one’s tastes,
> temperament and conception of the good. This is what Kantians call
> autonomy and Aristotelians practical reason. But the term personality
> implies something else as well, an element of spontaneity,
> individuality and spirit. Many philosophers—Kant himself springs to
> mind—have been models of rational self-government yet sadly lacking in
> personality.
>
> Why distinguish personality and respect? Are the two concepts not
> correlative: respect is paid to personality; personality calls forth
> respect? But there is a subtle difference. One can picture a
> community—a monastic order, say, or a revolutionary phalanx—where all
> property is shared, all affairs open to scrutiny, and all wills bent
> on the common good. Members of this community might hold each other in
> the highest respect yet would lack personality. Personality implies a
> private space, a “room behind the shop” as Montaigne called it, in
> which the individual is at liberty to unfurl, to be himself. It
> denotes the inward aspect of freedom, that which resists the claims of
> public reason and duty.
>
> Personality is pre-eminently a post-medieval, European ideal; it
> corresponds roughly to what the French liberal Benjamin Constant
> called “modern liberty.” But its appeal is not just local. All
> cultures have their holy fools and star-crossed lovers, honored in
> verse and song if not in real life. A society devoid of personality,
> where individuals accepted their social role without tension or
> protest, would scarcely be human. It would be more like a colony of
> intelligent social insects, of the sort envisaged in certain
> science-fiction films.
>
> There is a tendency in modern liberalism to elevate personality—or
> autonomy, as it is usually called—into the *ur*-good from which all
> others derive. Something like this underlies, as we saw, the
> reluctance of Rawls, Sen and Nussbaum to discuss final ends. We think
> this is a mistake. Autonomy is one good among others, with no special
> precedence. (It can, without obvious absurdity, be sacrificed to
> love.) Detached from any broader background of ethical concern,
> autonomy degenerates into that “liberty of indifference” for which all
> things are possible and nothing matters. The modern rhetoric of
> “choosing values” is one symptom of this confusion. Properly
> understood, choice *responds* to value. Where it is allowed to
> *create* value, its exercise becomes arbitrary—like firing arrows into
> a barn door and drawing targets around them.
>
> Private property is an essential safeguard of personality, for it
> allows individuals to live according to their own tastes and ideals,
> free from the tyranny of patronage and public opinion. “Stable
> fortunes … are an invisible social asset on which every kind of
> culture is more or less dependent,” wrote the French economist Marcel
> Labordère in a letter to Keynes. “Financial security for one’s
> livelihood is a necessary condition for organised leisure and thought.
> Organised leisure and thought is a necessary condition of a true, not
> purely mechanical, civilisation.”^17^ Note that it is specifically
> *property*, not income, that has this liberating influence. Soviet
> apparatchiks, with access to consumables of all sorts but not to
> capital, were not free to develop their personalities. Neither are
> those Wall Street traders whose huge pay packages vanish immediately
> in “necessary” expenses.^\*^ Independence is distinct from opulence,
> and vastly more important.
>
> This “personalist” defense of property is central to modern Catholic
> social teaching, where it forms part of a subtle, two-pronged attack
> on both free-market capitalism and state socialism. The foundation was
> laid in Pope Leo XIII’s Encyclical of 1891, *Rerum Novarum*. Every
> householder, argues Leo, should possess the means of providing for
> himself and his family now and in perpetuity. To be without such means
> is to be forced into a degrading dependence on the managers of
> capital, be they private individuals or state servants. “The law,
> therefore, should favour ownership, and its policy should be to induce
> as many as possible of the people to become owners.”^18^ These ideas
> were to flow into the “distributionist” movement of early
> twentieth-century England, as well as into Christian Democratic
> thought in Germany and Italy, as we shall see in the next chapter.
>
> The personalist argument for private property is distinct from the
> standard free-market one, and has different implications. For
> mainstream economics, property is simply part of the legal
> infrastructure of capitalism. Its distribution is not fundamentally a
> matter of concern, except insofar as it leads to monopoly pricing. By
> contrast, from a personalist point of view, the concentration of
> property in a few hands violates its essential function, which is to
> provide individuals and families with an independent livelihood.
> Property must be broadly distributed, or it cannot do its ethical job.
> How such a distribution might be brought about will be a central theme
> of the next chapter.

#### Harmony with Nature

> *Harmony with Nature*. The case for treating harmony with nature as a
> basic human good was argued for in the last chapter. But the issue
> remains controversial. Martha Nussbaum reports that some of her South
> Asian colleagues dismissed the whole idea as “a romantic Green Party
> flourish.”^19^ We have encountered a similar reaction from Chinese
> friends. There is no denying the proneness of modern Westerners to wax
> sentimental over nature, sometimes to the extent of overlooking the
> weightier demands of human suffering. Nonetheless, a sense of kinship
> with animals, plants and landscapes is hardly a Western peculiarity.
> The abundance of nature poetry in Sanskrit, classical Chinese and
> other languages around the world is sufficient proof of that.
>
> Harmony with nature has often been understood to favor rural over
> urban life. Ever since the days of Babylon and Rome, cities have
> appeared as sinks of squalor and vice. But the opposite point of view
> has also had its defenders. Socrates found all the wisdom he needed
> within the walls of Athens. Marx spoke of the idiocy of rural life.
> There is no need for us to enter into this old debate; both sides have
> some truth to them. What is new, however, is the sheer scale of the
> modern city. An inhabitant of eighteenth-century Paris, then the
> largest city in the world, had only to walk thirty minutes to find
> himself in farmland. His modern equivalent would have to walk six
> hours through crowded traffic. Here is the source of that typically
> modern feeling of urban malaise and that yearning, often comic in its
> effects, to “get back to nature.” The ill-effects of urban
> overcrowding on behavior and mood have been well documented by
> psychologists.
>
> Should we abolish the modern city, then? With current population
> densities, such a policy would only succeed in transforming the
> country into a vast suburb. But we *should* strive to ensure that
> cities are not entirely alienated from their rural surroundings. For
> millennia, local food markets served as the main point of contact
> between town and country. These are now largely gone, and with them
> all sense of place and season. The modern British foodie can tickle
> his jaded palate with Japanese tempura, Sichuan chili, Moroccan
> couscous and a host of other pickings from the global storehouse, all
> equally detached from any context of meaning. Alienation from nature
> is just one of the unpriced costs of consumer choice.

#### Friendship

> *Friendship*. This is a necessarily inadequate translation of the
> ancient Greek *philia*, a term encompassing all robust, affectionate
> relationships. A father, spouse, teacher and workmate might all be
> “friends” in our sense of the term. As mentioned above, this might
> seem to blur a crucial distinction between family relations, which are
> unchosen, and friendships in the strict sense, which are elective. But
> examined closely, the distinction is not so clear-cut. All family
> relationships have an elective element—beyond a certain point, one has
> to *work* at being a mother or a sister—and all deep non-family
> relationships have a binding force, often expressed by the extension
> to them of family terms: blood-brother, mother superior and so forth.
> Family and other personal relations vary in structure and importance
> from culture to culture, but some such relations are clearly essential
> to any conceivable version of the good life. “No one would choose to
> live without friends,” noted Aristotle, “even if he had the other good
> things.”^20^
>
> Why do we speak of “friendship” instead of “community,” a word that
> has become horribly popular in recent decades? Our concern has to do
> with reification. It is all too easy to talk about the “good of the
> community” as though this were something over and above the good of
> its constituent members. The term “friendship” is not open to this
> kind of abuse. My friendship with Paul is clearly a *relation* between
> me and Paul; it does not float above us, ghost-like, with interests
> and rights all of its own. If we could learn to think of communities
> in this fashion, as networks of friends, one notorious source of
> political oppression would be removed.
>
> Friendship was taken seriously in the ancient world. Aristotle, in his
> classic discussion of the subject, distinguishes friendship proper
> from utility-friendship (based on a coincidence of interests) and
> pleasure-friendship (based on shared amusements). True friendship
> exists when each party embraces the other’s good as his own, thereby
> bringing into being a new *common* good. It is a relationship possible
> only between people of virtue, who love one another for what they are,
> not for what they can offer. Friendship is both personal and
> political. It binds together members of a family and, by extension,
> citizens of a *polis*. It is “the greatest good of states and what
> best preserves them against revolutions.”^21^ These words sound
> strange to modern ears. We are used to thinking of the state as an
> alliance of self-interested individuals, and of friendship as a purely
> private relationship, of no political significance. But from
> Aristotle’s point of view, a state without friendship is no state at
> all. A state is not “a mere society … established for the prevention
> of mutual crime and for the sake of exchange.” It is “the union of
> families and villages in a perfect and self-sufficing life, by which
> we mean a happy and honourable life.”^22^
>
> Writing a hundred and fifty years before Aristotle, on the other side
> of the world, Confucius nonetheless shared his belief in the political
> importance of personal relationships. “Those who in private life
> behave well towards their parents and elder brothers, in public life
> seldom show a disposition to resist the authority of their
> superiors.”^23^ But the resemblance is superficial only. Confucius’
> focus is on deference to authority, not participation in shared goods.
> And whereas Aristotle subsumes the family under the broader heading of
> *philia*, the Chinese philosopher singles it out for special
> commendation. “Surely proper behaviour towards parents and elder
> brothers is the trunk of Goodness?”^24^ These differences of attitude
> are still visible today. Western children often grow up to view their
> parents as “friends” in the narrow sense, whereas in China the
> relationship remains one of mutual love and sacrifice throughout life.
>
> Friendship is not primarily an economic good, but it has economic
> prerequisites. Social trust does not flourish in times of famine. And
> an economy marked by continual restructuring, downsizing and
> outsourcing will not be hospitable to deep, long-lasting
> relationships. “You need to rid your life of Leeches and replace them
> with Energizers,” writes American lifestyle coach Robert Pagliarini, a
> message reiterated in countless self-help books and websites.^25^ In
> Aristotelian terms, friends acquired with the specific aim of
> “energizing” oneself are not real friends at all, but utility friends.
> Still, they are a predictable feature of a culture that prizes
> autonomy and mobility above almost all else.

#### Leisure

> *Leisure*. In contemporary parlance, leisure is synonymous with
> relaxation and rest. But there is another, older conception of
> leisure, according to which it is not just time off work but a special
> form of activity in its own right. **Leisure in this sense is that
> which we do for its own sake, not as a means to something else.** The
> philosopher Leo Strauss wrote of his friend Kurt Riezler that “the
> activity of his mind had the character of noble and serious employment
> of leisure, not of harried labor.”^26^ It is in this sense that we
> wish “leisure” to be understood.
>
> **Leisure in our sense has no very close connection to leisure as it
> is generally understood**. Paid work could be leisure in our sense if
> undertaken not primarily as a means to money but for its own sake.
> (Many writers would carry on writing even if they earned nothing for
> it, or could earn more doing something else.) Conversely, many
> “leisure activities” are not leisure in our sense, either because they
> are undertaken instrumentally—playing squash to lose weight, for
> instance—or because they are too passive to count as *action* at all.
> (**Watching television and getting drunk are actions only in the
> minimal sense that everything we do is an action. They lack the
> spontaneity and skill characteristic of action in the full sense, and
> are therefore best viewed as “rest” rather than leisure.**) Leisure in
> our sense is distinguished not by lack of seriousness or strenuousness
> but by absence of external compulsion. It thus comes close to what
> Marx called non-alienated labor, which he defined as “a free
> manifestation of life, hence an enjoyment of life.”^27^
>
> The importance of leisure has been recognized by civilizations across
> the world. The three great Abrahamic religions all set aside a weekly
> Sabbath or day of rest, though this is not quite leisure in our sense,
> being primarily for the purpose of worship, not free activity.^28^
> Aristotle came closer in his distinction between the “liberal” and
> “mechanical” arts, the former being those suitable to freemen, the
> later to workmen and slaves (“We call those arts mechanical which tend
> to deform the body, and likewise all paid employments, for they absorb
> and degrade the mind”).^29^ But it was in Edo Japan that the
> cultivation of leisure was taken furthest. Deprived by centuries of
> peace of its traditional occupations, the feudal aristocracy turned
> instead to the arts of life, transforming everyday activities like
> bathing and tea drinking into exquisite ceremonies. The French
> philosopher Alexandre Kojève looked to Japan as the first successful
> “post-historical” society. We may hope, he wrote, tongue only
> partially in cheek, “that the recently begun interaction between Japan
> and the Western World will finally lead not to a rebarbarization of
> the Japanese but to a ‘Japanization’ of the Westerners.”^30^
>
> Why is leisure a basic good? **The reason is clear: a life without
> leisure, where everything is done for the sake of something else, is
> vain indeed.** It is a life spent always in preparation, never in
> actual living. Leisure is the wellspring of higher thought and
> culture, for it is only when emancipated from the pressure of need
> that we really *look* at the world, ponder it in its distinct
> character and outline. (The ancient Greek for leisure, *schole*, hints
> at this connection.) “When we really let our minds rest
> contemplatively on a rose in bud, on a child at play, on a divine
> mystery, we are rested and quickened as though by a dreamless sleep,”
> writes Josef Pieper. “It is in these silent and receptive moments that
> the soul of man is sometimes visited by an awareness of what holds the
> world together.”^31^ Without leisure, there is no genuine, but only
> that “mechanical,” civilization spoken of by Marcel Labordère. The
> modern university, with its machinery of “targets” and “outputs,”
> embodies this grim spectre.
>
> Such a conception of leisure may seem narrowly highbrow, but that is
> not the intention. All recreations involving active, skilled
> participation—playing football in the park, making and decorating
> one’s own furniture, strumming the guitar with friends—are leisure in
> our sense. What matters is not the intellectual level of the activity,
> but its character of “purposiveness without purpose.”
>
> What are the economic conditions of leisure? First of all, a reduction
> of *toil*, a category that includes not just paid work but all
> necessary activity, including commuting and housework, and excludes
> paid work undertaken primarily for its own sake, such as that of the
> devoted writer or artisan. Where toil occupies so great a portion of
> one’s day as to leave time only for sleep and rest, leisure is
> impossible. But a mere reduction of toil is not sufficient for leisure
> in our sense, as the figure of Keynes’s bored housewife suggests. To
> live “wisely and agreeably and well” requires not just time but
> application and taste. It is ironic, if unsurprising, that the old
> arts of life—conversation, dancing, music-making—are atrophying just
> when we have most need of them. An economy geared to maximizing
> marketable output will tend to produce manufactured rather than
> spontaneous forms of leisure.

### Realising the Basic Goods

#### The role of the state …

> If the first goal of the individual is to realize the good life for
> himself, the first duty of the state is to realize, insofar as lies
> within its power, the good life for all citizens. (This principle of
> justice is founded on the good of mutual respect, as discussed above.)
> The qualification “insofar as lies within its power” is important.
> Health and friendship lie largely in the lap of fate. Personality,
> respect and leisure depend partly on individual agency. Still, the
> state has an important and legitimate role in creating the *material
> conditions* under which these and other goods can flourish. Such
> conditions include not just a certain overall level of national wealth
> but its just distribution, its wise public expenditure and much more
> besides. The rest lies in the hands of individuals and civil
> institutions. To adapt a phrase of Keynes, the state is the trustee
> not of civilization but of the possibility of civilization.

#### Health

-   *Health*. **Average life expectancy** in Britain rose by just over
    > seven years from 1974 to 2009. This increase owes little to
    > growth, however. Life expectancy has improved in almost all
    > countries over this period, regardless of growth rates, mainly as
    > a result of advances in medical technology and infrastructure.^36^
    > China and Brazil now trail the West by only six or seven years,
    > while Cuba, one of the poorer nations of the world, boasts a life
    > expectancy equal to that of the USA. Moreover, as argued above,
    > mere *length of life is a poor index of health*, since it tells us
    > nothing about *quality*. “The good life is surely not measured by
    > its length in years,” wrote an 86-year-old James Lovelock, “but by
    > the intensity of the joy and good consequences of existence.”^37^

-   health may actually be deteriorating with affluence

    -   Alcohol-related deaths, obesity, prescriptions for depression,
        > rise in depression, work-related stress

    -   By historical standards, we remain extremely healthy, but the
        > old assurance that this state of affairs would continue in
        > perpetuity is fading

#### Security

-   Full employment as a goal of macroeconomic policy was abandoned
    > during the Reagan/Thatcher era and has not been reinstated.

-   In Britain and the USA, **jobs for life have increasingly been
    > replaced by temporary or open contracts**. Job tenure for British
    > men fell 20 percent from 1975 to 1995.

-   At the same time, there has been a marked **growth in temporary**,
    > especially agency, workers, whose numbers have doubled since 1992

-   These trends are partly structural, an effect of the ongoing shift
    > from industry to services, but they have been exacerbated
    > by policy. Security has been regarded as a legitimate sacrifice to
    > the greater good of growth, not as a basic human need.

-   TODO: What about other aspects, such as crime, war, …?

#### Respect

-   The greatest barrier to mutual respect in most Western nations is
    > the **emergence**, beginning in the 1970s, **of a permanent body
    > of state dependants**.^\*^ Once shielded by a residue of Christian
    > and social democratic sentiment, “chavs” and “scroungers” are now
    > treated with open contempt in the press and on television. Another
    > barrier to mutual respect is **excessive inequality**. This
    > destroys respect not just for those at the bottom, but also those
    > at the top, especially if their advantages are perceived
    > as unmerited. Inequality has risen in most Western countries since
    > the 1970s, in Britain and the USA especially, as Chart 12 shows.
    > This trend is partly a function of autonomous social forces, but
    > the slashing of the top rate of income tax under Thatcher and
    > Reagan undoubtedly accentuated it.

-   Finally, the “**turbo-capitalism**” enshrined in Wall Street and the
    > City of London over the last thirty years has led to a
    > brutalization of working relations. “His BlackBerry and security
    > pass are taken from him by burly men, he has no further access to
    > work email, and five minutes to clear his desk,” runs an article
    > describing the fate of an equity analyst, sacked for taking time
    > off to see his sick wife.^43^ Such scenes are all too common.
    > Today, high salaries are no security against proletarianization
    > and its attendant humiliations.

#### Personality

-   We have said that the **main economic safeguard of personality is
    > property**. This might seem to spell good news for Britain, where
    > home ownership rose steadily over the course of the last century
    > and now stands at 68 percent, having fallen from an all-time high
    > of 71 percent in 2003. However, since most property is bought on
    > mortgage, with outright ownership coming only late in life, if at
    > all, its **effects are anything but emancipatory**. **Mortgaged
    > property binds its owner to a regular job**. It is specifically
    > *wealth*—that is, an individual’s total assets minus his or her
    > liabilities—that confers freedom to pursue an autonomous plan
    > of life.


-   The overall picture is not encouraging for the advocates of growth
    > at all cost. Despite the doubling of UK per capita income, we
    > possess no more of the basic goods than we did in 1974; in certain
    > respects, we possess less of them. We have chased after
    > superfluities and neglected necessities. This, incidentally, may
    > explain the “flat line” of happiness discussed in Chapter 4, if
    > indeed it is anything more than a statistical artifact. It could
    > be that people sense, correctly, that their lives are objectively
    > no better now than they were then. Jil Matheson, head of the UK
    > Office for National Statistics, has identified the things that
    > matter most for happiness as “health, relationships, work and the
    > environment”—a list that tallies closely with our basic goods.^55^
    > Given that our lives have not noticeably improved in these
    > respects since 1974, it is hardly surprising that we do not feel
