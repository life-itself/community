title: Atomic Habits by James Clear
---
Part of a plethora of [[self-help]] books. Generally a little sceptical of the mileage one gets -- a point I talk about more below in blindspots subsection. This one was recommended by a friend. Distilled from the fluff and helpful anecdotes we have a variety of tips like the following:

* Focus on small improvements: 1% compounded has a big impact [ed: *assuming* you can keep compounding]
* Habits follow a pattern of: cue => craving => response => reward (that end up linking the cue and the response)
* Habit scorecard: Log your habits and evaluate them
* Implementation intention help us cue situations to action. Implementation intentions look like
  * "When situation X arises, I will perform response Y" which can be used as
  *  "I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION]."
  * Examples:
    * Meditation. I will meditate for one minute at 7 a.m. in my kitchen.
    * Studying. I will study Spanish for twenty minutes at 6 p.m. in my bedroom.
    * Exercise. I will exercise for one hour at 5 p.m. in my local gym.
* Habit stacking: link one habit to the next to create a chain e.g. "After I do X I will do Y" (after I finish meditation I will do 10 press-ups).
  * Especially useful to create a new habit based on an existing one e.g. "After I pour my cup of coffee each morning, I will meditate for one minute."

As is common with these books, you could probably get most of the insight in a longish blog post.

### Blindspots of self-help: the implementation gap

What these books rarely cover is *why* some people are able to implement this and some don't. Most of this stuff amounts to hacks or micro-patterns. Whilst useful I'm dubious they really explain most of the reason people are effective or not at forming habits.

It's like the blindspot point from Landmark: most of us know what to do in a given area -- e.g. to lose weight you exercise and eat less -- and ... it is something deeper than a lack of knowledge that is preventing us taking action. So with habits: i suspect it is something deeper (and often hidden from view, blind-spot like) that is preventing us forming habits we want than the fact that I don't have a book of information and tips about habit formation (even if it's good).

Of course, cues *can* help but just in a rather limited way and maybe once you've cracked the other bigger stuff. In short, I'm saying material like this is useful but it probably only accounts for 1% or (at best) 10% -- though maybe it is a cheap 1% or 10%.

### Nice zen-like section on human nature

There's also an interesting ending section which comes pretty close to Zen / Buddhist teaching about desire, happiness etc (full excerpt below).

> **Happiness is simply the absence of desire.** When you observe a cue, but do not desire to change your state, you are content with the current situation. Happiness is not about the achievement of pleasure (which is joy or satisfaction), but about the lack of desire. It arrives when you have no urge to feel differently. Happiness is the state you enter when you no longer want to change your state.

# Summary

## HOW TO CREATE A GOOD HABIT

### The 1st Law: Make It Obvious

**1.1:** Fill out the Habits Scorecard. Write down your current habits to become aware of them.

**1.2:** Use implementation intentions: “I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].”

**1.3:** Use habit stacking: “After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].”

**1.4:** Design your environment. Make the cues of good habits obvious and visible.

### The 2nd Law: Make It Attractive

**2.1:** Use temptation bundling. Pair an action you _want_ to do with an action you _need_ to do.

**2.2:** Join a culture where your desired behavior is the normal behavior.

**2.3:** Create a motivation ritual. Do something you enjoy immediately before a difficult habit.

### The 3rd Law: Make It Easy

**3.1:** Reduce friction. Decrease the number of steps between you and your good habits.

**3.2:** Prime the environment. Prepare your environment to make future actions easier.

**3.3:** Master the decisive moment. Optimize the small choices that deliver outsized impact.

**3.4:** Use the Two-Minute Rule. Downscale your habits until they can be done in two minutes or less.

**3.5:** Automate your habits. Invest in technology and onetime purchases that lock in future behavior.

### The 4th Law: Make It Satisfying

**4.1:** Use reinforcement. Give yourself an immediate reward when you complete your habit.

**4.2:** Make “doing nothing” enjoyable. When avoiding a bad habit, design a way to see the benefits.

**4.3:** Use a habit tracker. Keep track of your habit streak and “don’t break the chain.”

**4.4:** Never miss twice. When you forget to do a habit, make sure you get back on track immediately.

## HOW TO BREAK A BAD HABIT

### Inversion of the 1st Law: Make It Invisible

**1.5:** Reduce exposure. Remove the cues of your bad habits from your environment.

### Inversion of the 2nd Law: Make It Unattractive

**2.4:** Reframe your mind-set. Highlight the benefits of avoiding your bad habits.

### Inversion of the 3rd Law: Make It Difficult

**3.6:** Increase friction. Increase the number of steps between you and your bad habits.

**3.7:** Use a commitment device. Restrict your future choices to the ones that benefit you.

### Inversion of the 4th Law: Make It Unsatisfying

**4.5:** Get an accountability partner. Ask someone to watch your behavior.

**4.6:** Create a habit contract. Make the costs of your bad habits public and painful.

## Log and evaluate

> One of our greatest challenges in changing habits is maintaining awareness of what we are actually doing. This helps explain why the consequences of bad habits can sneak up on us. We need a “point-and-call” system for our personal lives. That’s the origin of the Habits Scorecard, which is a simple exercise you can use to become more aware of your behavior. To create your own, make a list of your daily habits.
> 
> Here’s a sample of where your list might start:
> 
> -   Wake up
> -   Turn off alarm
> -   Check my phone
> -   Go to the bathroom
> -   Weigh myself
> -   Take a shower
> -   Brush my teeth
> -   Floss my teeth
> -   Put on deodorant
> -   Hang up towel to dry
> -   Get dressed
> -   Make a cup of tea
> 
> . . . and so on.
> 
> Once you have a full list, look at each behavior, and ask yourself, “Is this a good habit, a bad habit, or a neutral habit?” If it is a good habit, write “+” next to it. If it is a bad habit, write “–”. If it is a neutral habit, write “=”.
> 
> For example, the list above might look like this:
> 
> -   Wake up =
> -   Turn off alarm =
> -   Check my phone –
> -   Go to the bathroom =
> -   Weigh myself +
> -   Take a shower +
> -   Brush my teeth +
> -   Floss my teeth +
> -   Put on deodorant +
> -   Hang up towel to dry =
> -   Get dressed =
> -   Make a cup of tea +

## Implementation intentions

> The cues that can trigger a habit come in a wide range of forms—the feel of your phone buzzing in your pocket, the smell of chocolate chip cookies, the sound of ambulance sirens—but the two most common cues are time and location. Implementation intentions leverage both of these cues.
> 
> Broadly speaking, the format for creating an implementation intention is:
> 
> “When situation X arises, I will perform response Y.”
> 
> ...
> 
> 
> The simple way to apply this strategy to your habits is to fill out this sentence:
> 
> I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].
> 
> -  Meditation. I will meditate for one minute at 7 a.m. in my kitchen.
> -  Studying. I will study Spanish for twenty minutes at 6 p.m. in my bedroom.
> -  Exercise. I will exercise for one hour at 5 p.m. in my local gym.
> -  Marriage. I will make my partner a cup of tea at 8 a.m. in the kitchen.
> 
## Habit stacking

A way to link habits together.

> The habit stacking formula is:
>
> “After [CURRENT HABIT], I will [NEW HABIT].”

# The 3rd Law: Make it Easy

## 13. How to stop pro-crastinating by using the 2 minute rule

> Even when you know you should start small, it’s easy to start too big. When you dream about making a change, excitement inevitably takes over and you end up trying to do too much too soon. The most effective way I know to counteract this tendency is to use the _Two-Minute Rule_, which states, “When you start a new habit, it should take less than two minutes to do.”
> 
> You’ll find that nearly any habit can be scaled down into a two-minute version:
> 
> -   “Read before bed each night” becomes “Read one page.”
> -   “Do thirty minutes of yoga” becomes “Take out my yoga mat.”
> -   “Study for class” becomes “Open my notes.”
> -   “Fold the laundry” becomes “Fold one pair of socks.”
> -   “Run three miles” becomes “Tie my running shoes.”
> 
> The idea is to make your habits as easy as possible to start. Anyone can meditate for one minute, read one page, or put one item of clothing away. And, as we have just discussed, this is a powerful strategy because once you’ve started doing the right thing, it is much easier to continue doing it. A new habit should not feel like a challenge. The actions that _follow_ can be challenging, but the first two minutes should be easy. What you want is a “gateway habit” that naturally leads you down a more productive path.
> 
> You can usually figure out the gateway habits that will lead to your desired outcome by mapping out your goals on a scale from “very easy” to “very hard.” For instance, running a marathon is very hard. Running a 5K is hard. Walking ten thousand steps is moderately difficult. Walking ten minutes is easy. And putting on your running shoes is very easy. Your goal might be to run a marathon, but your gateway habit is to put on your running shoes. That’s how you follow the Two-Minute Rule.
> 


> | Very easy                 | Easy                  | Moderate                 | Hard                               | Very hard      |
> | ------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------------------- | -------------- |
> | Put on your running shoes | Walk ten minutes      | Walk ten thousand steps  | Run a 5K                           | Run a marathon |
> | Write one sentence        | Write one paragraph   | Write one thousand words | Write a five-thousand-word article | Write a book   |
> | Open your notes           | Study for ten minutes | Study for three hours    | Get straight A’s                   | Earn a PhD     |
> 
> People often think it’s weird to get hyped about reading one page or meditating for one minute or making one sales call. But the point is not to do one thing. The point is to master the habit of showing up. The truth is, a habit must be established before it can be improved. If you can’t learn the basic skill of showing up, then you have little hope of mastering the finer details. Instead of trying to engineer a perfect habit from the start, do the easy thing on a more consistent basis. You have to standardize before you can optimize.
> 
> As you master the art of showing up, the first two minutes simply become a ritual at the beginning of a larger routine. This is not merely a hack to make habits easier but actually the ideal way to master a difficult skill. The more you ritualize the beginning of a process, the more likely it becomes that you can slip into the state of deep focus that is required to do great things. By doing the same warm-up before every workout, you make it easier to get into a state of peak performance. By following the same creative ritual, you make it easier to get into the hard work of creating. By developing a consistent power-down habit, you make it easier to get to bed at a reasonable time each night. You may not be able to automate the whole process, but you can make the first action mindless. Make it easy to start and the rest will follow.

## 14. How to make good habits inevitable and bad habits impossible

Use commitment strategies (e.g. don't buy the cigarettes in the first place). That's it!


## The Zen part at the end (Little Lessons from the 4 laws)

> IN THIS BOOK, I have introduced a four-step model for human behavior: cue, craving, response, reward. This framework not only teaches us how to create new habits but also reveals some interesting insights about human behavior.
> 
> Problem phase
> 
> **1. Cue**
> **2. Craving**
> 
> Solution phase
> 
> **3. Response**
> **4. Reward**
> 
> In this section, I have compiled some lessons (and a few bits of common sense) that are confirmed by the model. The purpose of these examples is to clarify just how useful and wide-ranging this framework is when describing human behavior. Once you understand the model, you’ll see examples of it everywhere.
> 
> **Awareness comes before desire.** A craving is created when you assign meaning to a cue. Your brain constructs an emotion or feeling to describe your current situation, and that means a craving can only occur after you have noticed an opportunity.
> 
> **Happiness is simply the absence of desire.** When you observe a cue, but do not desire to change your state, you are content with the current situation. Happiness is not about the achievement of pleasure (which is joy or satisfaction), but about the lack of desire. It arrives when you have no urge to feel differently. Happiness is the state you enter when you no longer want to change your state.
> 
> However, happiness is fleeting because a new desire always comes along. As Caed Budris says, “Happiness is the space between one desire being fulfilled and a new desire forming.” Likewise, suffering is the space between craving a change in state and getting it.
> 
> **It is the** idea **of pleasure that we chase.** We seek the image of pleasure that we generate in our minds. At the time of action, we do not know what it will be like to attain that image (or even if it will satisfy us). The feeling of satisfaction only comes afterward. This is what the Austrian neurologist Victor Frankl meant when he said that happiness cannot be pursued, it must ensue. Desire is pursued. Pleasure ensues from action.
> 
> **Peace occurs when you don’t turn your observations into problems.** The first step in any behavior is observation. You notice a cue, a bit of information, an event. If you do not desire to act on what you observe, then you are at peace.
> 
> Craving is about wanting to fix everything. Observation without craving is the realization that you do not need to fix anything. Your desires are not running rampant. You do not crave a change in state. Your mind does not generate a problem for you to solve. You’re simply observing and existing.
> 
> **With a big enough why you can overcome any how**. Friedrich Nietzsche, the German philosopher and poet, famously wrote, “He who has a why to live for can bear almost any how.” This phrase harbors an important truth about human behavior. If your motivation and desire are great enough (that is, _why_ are you are acting), you’ll take action even when it is quite difficult. Great craving can power great action—even when friction is high.
> 
> **Being curious is better than being smart.** Being motivated and curious counts for more than being smart because it leads to action. Being smart will never deliver results on its own because it doesn’t get you to act. It is desire, not intelligence, that prompts behavior. As Naval Ravikant says, “The trick to doing anything is first cultivating a desire for it.”
> 
> **Emotions drive behavior.** Every decision is an emotional decision at some level. Whatever your logical reasons are for taking action, you only feel compelled to act on them because of emotion. In fact, people with damage to emotional centers of the brain can list many reasons for taking action but still will not act because they do not have emotions to drive them. This is why craving comes _before_ response. The feeling comes first, and then the behavior.
> 
> **We can only be rational and logical** after **we have been emotional.** The primary mode of the brain is to feel; the secondary mode is to think. Our first response—the fast, nonconscious portion of the brain—is optimized for feeling and anticipating. Our second response—the slow, conscious portion of the brain—is the part that does the “thinking.”
> 
> Psychologists refer to this as System 1 (feelings and rapid judgments) versus System 2 (rational analysis). The feeling comes first (System 1); the rationality only intervenes later (System 2). This works great when the two are aligned, but it results in illogical and emotional thinking when they are not.
> 
> **Your response tends to follow your emotions.** Our thoughts and actions are rooted in what we find attractive, not necessarily in what is logical. Two people can notice the same set of facts and respond very differently because they run those facts through their unique emotional filter. This is one reason why appealing to emotion is typically more powerful than appealing to reason. If a topic makes someone feel emotional, they will rarely be interested in the data. This is why emotions can be such a threat to wise decision making.
> 
> Put another way: most people believe that the reasonable response is the one that benefits them: the one that satisfies their desires. To approach a situation from a more neutral emotional position allows you to base your response on the data rather than the emotion.
> 
> **Suffering drives progress.** The source of all suffering is the desire for a change in state. This is also the source of all progress. The desire to change your state is what powers you to take action. It is wanting more that pushes humanity to seek improvements, develop new technologies, and reach for a higher level. With craving, we are dissatisfied but driven. Without craving, we are satisfied but lack ambition.
> 
> **Your actions reveal how badly you want something.** If you keep saying something is a priority but you never act on it, then you don’t really want it. It’s time to have an honest conversation with yourself. Your actions reveal your true motivations.
> 
> **Reward is on the other side of sacrifice.** Response (sacrifice of energy) always precedes reward (the collection of resources). The “runner’s high” only comes after the hard run. The reward only comes after the energy is spent.
> 
> **Self-control is difficult because it is not satisfying.** A reward is an outcome that satisfies your craving. This makes self-control ineffective because inhibiting our desires does not usually resolve them. Resisting temptation does not satisfy your craving; it just ignores it. It creates space for the craving to pass. Self-control requires you to release a desire rather than satisfy it.
> 
> **Our expectations determine our satisfaction.** The gap between our cravings and our rewards determines how satisfied we feel after taking action. If the mismatch between expectations and outcomes is positive (surprise and delight), then we are more likely to repeat a behavior in the future. If the mismatch is negative (disappointment and frustration), then we are less likely to do so.
> 
> For example, if you expect to get $10 and get $100, you feel great. If you expect to get $100 and get $10, you feel disappointed. Your expectation changes your satisfaction. An average experience preceded by high expectations is a disappointment. An average experience preceded by low expectations is a delight. When liking and wanting are approximately the same, you feel satisfied.
> 
> Satisfaction = Liking – Wanting
> 
> This is the wisdom behind Seneca’s famous quote, “Being poor is not having too little, it is wanting more.” If your wants outpace your likes, you’ll always be unsatisfied. You’re perpetually putting more weight on the problem than the solution.
> 
> Happiness is relative. When I first began sharing my writing publicly it took me three months to get one thousand subscribers. When I hit that milestone, I told my parents and my girlfriend. We celebrated. I felt excited and motivated. A few years later, I realized that one thousand people were signing up each day. And yet I didn’t even think to tell anyone. It felt normal. I was getting results ninety times faster than before but experiencing little pleasure over it. It wasn’t until a few days later that I realized how absurd it was that I wasn’t celebrating something that would have seemed like a pipe dream just a few years before.
> 
> **The pain of failure correlates to the height of expectation.** When desire is high, it hurts to not _like_ the outcome. Failing to attain something you want hurts more than failing to attain something you didn’t think much about in the first place. This is why people say, “I don’t want to get my hopes up.”
> 
> **Feelings come both before and after the behavior.** Before acting, there is a feeling that motivates you to act—the craving. After acting, there is a feeling that teaches you to repeat the action in the future—the reward.
> 
> Cue > Craving (Feeling) > Response > Reward (Feeling)
> 
> How we feel influences how we act, and how we act influences how we feel.
> 
> **Desire initiates. Pleasure sustains.** Wanting and liking are the two drivers of behavior. If it’s not desirable, you have no reason to do it. Desire and craving are what initiate a behavior. But if it’s not enjoyable, you have no reason to repeat it. Pleasure and satisfaction are what sustain a behavior. Feeling motivated gets you to act. Feeling successful gets you to repeat.
> 
> **Hope declines with experience and is replaced by acceptance.** The first time an opportunity arises, there is hope of what could be. Your expectation (cravings) is based solely on _promise_. The second time around, your expectation is grounded in reality. You begin to understand how the process works and your hope is gradually traded for a more accurate prediction and acceptance of the likely outcome.
> 
> This is one reason why we continually grasp for the latest get-rich-quick or weight-loss scheme. New plans offer hope because we don’t have any experiences to ground our expectations. New strategies seem more appealing than old ones because they can have unbounded hope. As Aristotle noted, “Youth is easily deceived because it is quick to hope.” Perhaps this can be revised to “Youth is easily deceived because it only hopes.” There is no experience to root the expectation in. In the beginning, hope is all you have.
