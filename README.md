Welcome to the Life Itself primary repo. This repo powers the next generation website and especially our digital notebook/garden.

Two main parts:

`vault/` most of the content including digital notebook/garden (recommending editing in obsidian)

`site/` flowershow and nextjs based webapp that creates the life itself website (mainly using content from vault!)
