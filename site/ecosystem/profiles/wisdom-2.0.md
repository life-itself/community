We are community dedicated to creating a world of deeper Wisdom, and Compassion. Join us along with leaders in Business, Healing, and Social Change for our annual event, with 5 stages and over 2,500 people from 30 countries. Through our series of conferences, meet-ups, and workshops, Wisdom 2.0 strives to bring this conversation to the world in an accessible, innovative, and inclusive way. Featured in the New York Times, Wired, Fast Company, Huffington Post, Financial Times, Forbes and many other business magazines, the Wisdom 2.0 Summit has sparked an ardent discussion in Silicon Valley, New York business circles, and in communities around the globe of the value of mindfulness in our high-speed, interconnected age.
