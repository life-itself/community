We are a non-profit organisation that bridges and integrates contemplative practices and wisdom with modern research capabilities. 

We do that by working with leaders in the field of science, education, contemplation and human development using the knowledge in effective programs at the grass-roots level in Europe in order to decrease suffering and promote human flourishing.

Science is the dominant framework for investigating the nature of reality. It is the modern source for knowledge that could help improve the lives of humans and the planet. However, an increasing number of scientists find that science based on empiricism, technology, and objective observation and analysis, does not provide enough insights to contribute to human flourishing.

Mind & Life Europe believes that well-refined contemplative practices and introspective methods are instruments of investigation that allow us to fully understand the human mind and the subjective experience of life. This is known as ‘contemplative science’.

This type of science has established that contemplative practice has measurable effects on the human brain, on nutrition and wellbeing. It has also shown that contemplative practice cultivates positive mental qualities such as care and compassion.

By providing a complete image of the mind and its potential to develop positive mental states, contemplative science not only makes science itself more humane but also ensures that its conclusions can contribute to human and societal flourishing.

At Mind & Life Europe, we foster an interdisciplinary dialogue between scientists, contemplative scholars, researchers and encourage them to collaborate to advance contemplative science. We share our findings with professionals in the fields of education, healthcare and organisations and develop solutions to implement change in these sectors.
