Schumacher College is an internationally renowned learning community offering ecology-centred masters, short course and horticulture programmes.

We focus on interactive and experiential education to develop practical skills and strategic thinking required to face 21st century challenges. Students work together in small groups which embrace the learning principles of head, hand, heart. Many of our courses feature guest teachers who are world-renowned thinkers, activists and practioners.

We are a vegetarian college and we continually strive to be as self-sufficient as possible. At present we grow almost 50% of the food we eat, the rest we source as locally as possible. All students and staff are involved with cooking, cleaning and gardening which helps to foster a sense of community and is a great opportunity to mix with all members of the College.
