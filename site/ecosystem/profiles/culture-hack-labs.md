Culture Hack Labs (CHL) is a not-for-profit consultancy that supports organizations, social movements and activists to create cultural interventions for systems change.

CHL's process is based on an integrated set of tools and techniques to track, research and intervene in cultural narratives. They capture and map large volumes of social data using the Culture Hack Platform. They then analyze the networks, language, and deep logics to develop insights and content to evolve culture.
