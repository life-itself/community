Envisioning
Society in 2045
We are seeking to change the way society works by bringing together those on the leading edge of individual, social, and systems evolution movements. A global group of people come together regularly to contribute their vision of the society they want to see by 2045. Each individual's unique experience, efforts, and networks helps create a positive holistic vision to guide us through the opportunities ahead.
