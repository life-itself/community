The Liminal Village is a co-living co-creation-space in a networked-rural setting, where we experiment with holistic and alternative technologies to co-create open-source and globally applicable solutions using Blockchain, Artificial Intelligence, Permaculture, Pain Medicine. 

It is a place without spectators, as all the guests participate in the creation of the program, giving talks and workshops about their knowledge or passions.
