We host a variety of online and in-person programs and events featuring Emergence staff and contributors, aimed at providing a space where our wider community can connect through the power of story and explore the connections between culture, ecology, and spirituality. We are excited about finding creative ways to engage with you through our online book club, workshops, immersive leadership courses, gallery installations, conversations with contributors, and live pop-up events.
