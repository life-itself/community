Demos Helsinki is a think tank.

They conduct research, offer consulting services, and host a global alliance of social imagination.

They intentionally strive to hold and balance exquisite tensions that pervade todayâ€™s societal structures and actors. Their work conceptually and practically reflects their mission: that transformative change is needed. They believe this change includes a spectrum of partners, and the many unlikely alliances it manifests, across societal sectors and geographies.
