The Cascade Institute is a Canadian research center that addresses the full range of humanity’s converging environmental, economic, political, technological, and health crises. Using advanced methods to map and model complex global systems, the Cascade Institute analyzes the interactions between systemic risks, anticipates future crises and opportunities, and develops high-leverage interventions in social systems that could rapidly shift humanity’s course towards fair and sustainable prosperity.

The Cascade Institute's core mission is to prepare governments, businesses, civil society groups, and frontline actors to face emerging risks—and help them take actions that will trigger a fundamental, rapid, and positive shift in humanity’s trajectory towards fair and sustainable prosperity. The Institute provides these front-line leaders with a better understanding of the problem landscape and develop the most promising possibilities for high-impact interventions.
