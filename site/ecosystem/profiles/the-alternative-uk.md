The Alternative UK is a political platform based in the United Kingdom. Through curation, editorial, public events, commissioning and research, we aim to transform the language and practice of politics on these islands. Inspired by and associated with Alternativet in Denmark, we are trying to bring about 'a friendly revolution'.

We face broader forces and trends which are (intentionally) coarsening citizens' responses to each other, and to the complexities of living on this planet. We want to seed and and cultivate a way of being citizens, which taps into our creativity, our fellow-feeling and the power of the networks at our fingertips.
