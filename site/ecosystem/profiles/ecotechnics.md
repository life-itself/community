Pursuing the harmony of ecology and technology since 1973. The Institute of Ecotechnics thinks and acts on a planetary scale. What drives our work is the realization that our current ecological crisis is the growing imbalance between “technosphere” and “biosphere.”  This was why we at Ecotechnics set our goal to develop systems that harmonize eco and techno.
