Post Carbon Instituteâ€™s mission is to lead the transition to a more resilient, equitable, and sustainable world by providing individuals and communities with the resources needed to understand and respond to the interrelated ecological, economic, energy, and equity crises of the 21st century.

Post Carbon Institute provides individuals and communities with the resources needed to understand and respond to the interrelated ecological, economic, energy, and equity crises of the 21st century. They help build resilience to withstand these crises, and support social and cultural change to make society more ready to take decisive and appropriate action. Specifically, they:

* Grow collective understanding of our energy reality, and the need for both conservation and appropriate, community-centric renewable energy.
* Promote community resilience as the best way to build thriving, relocalized neighborhoods, towns, and cities capable of withstanding coming disruptions.
* Support a growing movement of innovators and early adopters who can develop best practices and provide leadership both now and during future crises.
