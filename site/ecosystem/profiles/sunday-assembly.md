Sunday Assembly was started by Sanderson Jones and Pippa Evans, two comedians who were on their way to a gig in Bath when they discovered they both wanted to do something that was like church but totally secular and inclusive of allâ€”no matter what they believed. The first ever Sunday Assembly meeting took place on January 6th 2013 at The Nave in Islington. Almost 200 people turned up at the first meeting.

Now there are over 40 Sunday Assemblies around the world, operating independently, where people sing songs, hear inspiring talks, and create community together in a family-friendly and inclusive setting.
