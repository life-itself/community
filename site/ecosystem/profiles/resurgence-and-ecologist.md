Welcome to The Resurgence Trust, where you'll find positive, informed and original perspectives on environmental issues, activism, social justice, arts and ethical living

The Resurgence Trust is an educational charity at the forefront of a movement for change. The charity was established in 2006 to further the educational work of Resurgence magazine.

The Resurgence Trust informs the environmental debate, inspires a culture of optimism and guides us towards positive solutions to the global challenges we now face.

The aim of charity is to foster a greater connection to Nature to enhance personal wellbeing, support resilient communities and inform social change towards regenerative societies that enrich our natural environment.

The charity works to advance education on a range of issues including conservation, regeneration of the natural environment, arts, and culture. The Trust achieves this through three main programmes - the publication of Resurgence & Ecologist, the publication of The Ecologist website, and the production of dynamic a series of events, conferences and workshops.

Through implementing the Trust's charitable objectives, we aim to raise awareness of the opportunities for positive change, inspire action and facilitate debates.
