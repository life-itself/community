Borrowing from the ancient wisdom traditions and modern self-directed learning movement, the Wisdom Hackers community will bring together leading young thinkers from art, technology, literature, activism, design and innovation to explore a fundamental angst. We are exploring what a learning community outside of traditional structures can be. A world where wisdom isn’t marginalized, but where spirited inquiry into life’s meta-questions is actively encouraged. Where communities are given permission to spend time exploring pressing curiosities and are able share their learning and insight back to the wider public.
