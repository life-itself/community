Our aim is to discover, design and develop the institutional ‘dark matter’ that supports a more democratic, distributed and sustainable future.

We are a multidisciplinary design team working with partners, clients, and collaborators across the world to develop new working methods for system change.

Dark Matter Labs utilises an experiment methodology typical of a fieldwork laboratory – undertaking real-world research and prototyping to develop new models of 21st century institutional infrastructure.

Our work is based around collaborative, strategic experiments to learn about the ‘dark matter’ of systems; from policy and regulation, finance and data, governance and organisational culture, to identity and democratic participation.
