Resilience.org aims to support building community resilience in a world of multiple emerging challenges: the decline of cheap energy, the depletion of critical resources like water, complex environmental crises like climate change and biodiversity loss, and the social and economic issues which are linked to these. The site is designed to act as a community library with space to read and think, but also as a vibrant caf√© in which to meet people, discuss ideas and projects, and pick up and share tips on how to build the resilience of your community, your household, or yourself.

They publish news, research, and analysis in five broad categories:
* Energy
* Economy
* Environment
* Food & Water
* Society

The articles, reports, and analyses on resilience.org explore the implications of these issues across broad areas including geopolitics, ecology, population, finance, urban design, health, and even religious and gender issues. They also publish articles which demonstrate practical models of how to respond to these issues in your community.
