The On Being Project is a nonprofit media and public life initiative. We make a public radio show, podcasts, and tools for the art of living.  Pursuing deep thinking and moral imagination, social courage and joy, to renew inner life, outer life, and life together. Attending to the wholeness of every person: the life of the mind, the truth of the body, and the wild mystery of the human spirit.

This is what we do. Through content, experiences, accompaniment, and practical tools, The On Being Project tends the human change that makes social transformation possible.
