  I'm Scott Shadian the Co-Founder of Sayara International, a global development
  impact firm that specializes in the design and implementation of rigorous
  research, social and behavioral change communications, and community based
  strategies in conflict-affected and transitioning societies in 30 countries
  around the globe. Our team recently led Sayara's evacuation operation in
  Afghanistan, which culminated in the evacuation of 1200 vulnerable Afghans
  (you can read more about that operation in a recent NYT Magazine article,
  here. Sayara is featured in "Part 3: Evacuation").


  Brief on Emergence Field Labs


  Events such as the January 6th Insurrection and the fall of Kabul, along with rising gun-violence and hyperpolarization in the US point to structural and systemic failures of institutions to overcome siloed-thinking, lagging impact, inability to scale programming and understand failure within the constraints of government and philanthropic programming to affect positive social change. In response, Sayara is developing a new global research laboratory, Emergence Field Labs (B-Corp), which will break-down silos of traditional research and incorporate emergent social behavioral theories-of-change through on-going relationships with academia (i.e. Oxfords 'Social Cohesion model' & Yale's 'BioSocial Network Model'), while employing complexity science  (i.e Columbia's 'Dynamic Systems Theory'), as opposed to relying solely on quantitative modeling.


  Using on-the-ground-demonstrations and crowdsourcing to test, adapt and validate emergent social change models, Emergence will become the first organization dedicated to scientifically demonstrating and validating novel metrics in support of social impact, leading to the creation of foundational indexes and analytics: e.g. social cohesion, stability, resilience, polarization, climate resilience and peacebuilding. By becoming a key bridge between government/philanthropy academia and civil society, Emergence will discover and apply novel research frameworks and intervention models to the world's most urgent issues, seeking causal and scalable solutions, as opposed to symptomatic treatments of social problems, such: gun violence reduction, hyper-polarization, income inequality (UBI), and gender-based violence. Ultimately, this continuous stream of data will support the development of a machine learning algorithm, Mycelium, which will be built upon the novel learning frameworks validated in the field by Emergence's global research network, producing critical data and indexes for government, philanthropy and impact investment objectives.
