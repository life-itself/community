The Center for Applied Cultural Evolution has the mission to apply insights from cultural evolutionary studies to pressing social problems affecting human communities around the world. 

We provide a bridge between researchers who study cultural change from diverse disciplinary backgrounds and practitioners seeking to guide the evolution of their communities to address chronic problems that impact the people living within them. 

In simple terms, you can think of the Center for Applied Cultural Evolution as a gathering place for scholars and practitioners to set up field sites for applied cultural evolution research that support change makers as they go about their work of making the world a better place.
