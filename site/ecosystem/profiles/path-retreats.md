For the past 40 years, Turiya and Rafia, the Path Retreats founders, have been training in a multitude of spiritual and therapeutic modalities. 

For a great part of that time they also received personal guidance and life-training from Osho, an enlightened master, which has given them a deep understanding and great sensitivity to the powerful, yet subtle inter-relatedness of psychological issues and the realization of true spiritual nature. 

The influence of Osho is foundational to the Path of Love 7-Day process, and the first Path of Love was held in 1995 at the Osho International Meditation Resort in India, which today remains one of the foremost meditation centers in the world.
