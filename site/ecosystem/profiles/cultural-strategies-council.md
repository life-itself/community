Established in 2008, after a decade of working across civil society, the Cultural Strategies Council (CSC) is a vehicle for interdisciplinary research, strategy, and collaborative learning. The CSC has significant experience working with a diverse range of partners to conceive, develop, and implement transformative change initiatives that advance a more just and regenerative world. This work is predicated on the belief that societyâ€™s capacity to transcend existing challenges, address complex issues, and adapt to uncertainty relies on our ability to envisage, assess, and realize alternative futures cooperatively.
