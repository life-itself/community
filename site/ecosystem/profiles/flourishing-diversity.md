We co-create spaces that invite you to listen, exchange, envision and act upon three foundational principles:
1. Life on earth is possible because of biological and cultural diversity, where each part is equally vital to the whole.
2. The ecological crisis is calling us to deepen our connections to the planet and all its living species.
3. Humans have an inherent ability to be guardians of the environments we inhabit and directly enhance them in ways that support all species to flourish and thrive in their own way.

These principles are understood in many Indigenous cultures and earth-based communities. They have been further explored through anthropological and conservation research carried out by Flourishing Diversity co-founders and individuals, communities and organisations that are part of our ecosystem.
