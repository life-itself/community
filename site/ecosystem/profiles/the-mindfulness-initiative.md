The Mindfulness Initiative was founded by Madeleine Bunting and Chris Cullen in November 2013 to support British politicians in forming the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Mindfulness. 

Our partners include the four mindfulness training and research centres in Bangor, Exeter, Oxford and Sussex universities, as well as the Mental Health Foundation, Mindfulness Association and Breathworks, and we benefit from an advisory group comprising some of the most experienced mindfulness scientists and practitioners in the UK and around the world. Our patrons are Jon Kabat-Zinn and Ruby Wax, and our director is Jamie Bristow, who took over from the previous directors in May 2015. 

The Mindfulness Initiative has a talented team of consultants 'policy leads' and associates who are engaged to work on specific strategy areas or projects on a part-time or ad-hoc basis. These consultants contribute immensely to our work, coming from the fields of mindfulness research and wider academia, mindfulness teaching, policy development and advocacy. 

We are grateful for the generous support of The Lostand Foundation, Sankalpa and The Mindful Trust, among others.
