UNTITLED is an alliance and an approach to collectively reimagine society, create an agenda for social transformation and experiment on executing it. It is founded by an alliance of activists across sectors. The community works together at meet ups throughout the year, collaborates around real-life experiments, celebrates at a festival and spreads the story via publications.
