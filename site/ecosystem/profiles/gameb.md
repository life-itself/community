We're gaining the power of gods, but without the love, wisdom and discernment of godsâ€”that is a self-extinctionary scenario. 

Welcome to Game B, a transcontextual inquiry into a new social operating system for humanity. 

Game A is what got us to this time of metacrisis and collapse. Game B is what emerges in response. 

Come play with us as we learn to become wiser, together, gain coherence and begin to move towards a new social operating system emphasizing human wellbeing, metastability, and built on good values that we will be happy to call home and we will be proud to leave to our descendants.
