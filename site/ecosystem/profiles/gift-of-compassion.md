Run by Angelo Oh of Commonweal. Gift of Compassion is artist Ying Ming Tu (Tu-2) and mediator Angela E. Oh, zazen practitioners who have joined with many others to find the humbling truth, spoken by elders before them:  Perhaps the true meaning of life is nothing more than to learn to love better. Since 2016, GoC has created workshops, fundraisers, and fellowships for underserved and under-resourced groups such as transition aged youth, social justice advocates and organizers, prisoners coming home to community, people looking for a path to heal, and anyone interested in realizing their own human potential. The common thread is an experience of harmony, clarity, and lightness. And the method is to enter into a moment of quiet, stillness, and silence.
