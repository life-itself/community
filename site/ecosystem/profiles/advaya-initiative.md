Advaya is a systems change initiative building a community of change-makers around the principles of radical regeneration and joyful revolution.

It is a global platform for transformative education that sits at the intersection of ecology, wellbeing, and community. Our events, online courses and media platform link inner transformation with outer change, weaving stories of beautiful transformation, resistance and renewal.
