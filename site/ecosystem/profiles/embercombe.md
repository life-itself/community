Embercombe is a beautiful and wilding 50 acre valley on the edge of Dartmoor. 

It is place to find a deep connection with nature â€“ wild nature around us and wild nature within us. It is a place to breathe, to reconsider, to regenerate and to relearn. It is a place to get clear on what it is you have to offer the world and become passionate about who you are and what you do. It is a place to join the conversation, pick up the skills and get started.
