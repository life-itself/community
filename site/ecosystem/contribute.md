# Contribute

From the outset, we have argued that any successful mapping effort must be collaborative and participatory. We hope that by opening this project up to the contributions of others, we can support the ongoing growth of our contributor community, and empower users to continue in collective efforts to make the map ever more useful and informative.

## Edit or add to the site via Github

We have given the site a wiki-like structure, meaning people can contribute and add items directly - no coding required. So, if you know of an organization that you think should be on our map, or see something you think needs amending, go ahead and contribute to our site! We have written up a guide detailing how anyone can edit or add content to our site themselves using Github. 

Find our contributors' guide [here](/contributors-guide).

Alternatively, if you would like to contribute by a more non-technical method, see below.

## Get in touch to get involved

Do you have a deep understanding of one (or more) of the ecosystem’s key traditions, movements, or philosophies? We’re looking to build up a library of content to help people understand the ideas and work of the ecosystem better. This might include material on key terms, influential ideas, major figures, history/lineage etc. If you have, or would like to write, content that you think might fit well in this library, please [get in touch &raquo;][contact].

We'd love help in every area of this project from research and writing to visualization and coding. If you'd like to get involved, or are already doing work you think might be complementary then please [get in touch &raquo;][contact].

## Resourcing

We would welcome the sharing of any opportunities for resourcing, or offers of direct support! We are currently undertaking the project using only our own internal resources, which limits the scope and speed of our activities. Additional resources could make a big difference to sustaining and expanding this work. [Get in touch &raquo;][contact].
