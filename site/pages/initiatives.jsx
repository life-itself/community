        <p>How do we bring about the shifts in being, culture and systems necessary to 
          transform our social paradigm, and steer humanity and the planet into a flourishing future?</p>
        
        <p>Here at Life Itself, we engage in many different projects. Some are experiments, others stand 
          alone works, and others are ongoing explorations. All are designed to create a wiser, weller world. 
          Our projects fall under two broad themes:</p>

        <h3>Pioneering Community Living</h3>

        <p>At the core of what we do is the thesis that community living is key to embodying true transformation 
          of ourselves and society.</p>
          
        <p>Why is community living so important? Because we need to combine inner transformation and outer development. 
          This is difficult, but living in a conscious community makes it easier. You have mutual support, accountability, 
          responsibility, connection.</p>
          
        <p>This is why we dedicate ourselves to creating pathways and providing tools for people to live in intentional communities.</p>
          
        <p>Examples: <Link href="/hubs">Co-living Hubs</Link>, <Link href="/initiatives/embodying-collective-transformation">Transformational Community Residencies</Link></p>

        <h3>Transforming the Narrative</h3>

        <p>We are undergoing one of the greatest paradigm shifts in history. At itâ€™s foundations this shift requires a new way of being and new ways of doing.</p>

        <p>Our work brings inner transformation out of the domain of the purely spiritual, and seeks to cement it as a pillar of social change that works for all. We use rigorous enquiry and sensemaking to better understand how we can make this paradigm shift a positive transformation for society.</p>
