We will respond to uncertainty together, with collective embodied practices that include deep attention to humble activities like breathing, creating living space, or preparing food together. \n\nBeyond the seemingly paradoxical nature of contemplative activism, we carry the intention of the ungraspable concept of a metamodern monastery. Our vision is to create a space where individuals can come together to explore, practice, and embody new ways of being and relating to each other and the world.\n\nThe Praxis Hub is a space devoted to the development and deepening of practices for an integrative response to our cultural situation. The Hub hosts residencies at the service of change agents. A laboratory to test and develop collective practices that can support our capacity to be together in this time of complexity, both individually and collectively.\n\nThe Hub is an experiential place that seeks to highlight the activation process resulting from community living. A proposal that aims to bring out another way of thinking and living in the world by questioning the relationship between the intimate and the collective along the question of alterity.\n\n**We envision this space as a laboratory for systemic transformation, where we can document and study the effects of our practices on individual and collective wisdom.** \n\n**Our ultimate goal is to create a model for a receptive way of living, where deep listening informs us towards a transformation grounded in the values of curiosity, engagement and trust.**\n\n## The Praxis residencies and gatherings \n\nWe are running and hosting a series of [residencies and retreats](https://lifeitself.org/upcoming-residencies-gatherings) that are a spiritual cooking together of various ingredients: people, practices, workshops, art, community life and actual cooking. The residences open a space, a vacuum filled by people and practices too spiritual for politics, too “political” for the monasteries, where we sit with our trouble without giving into the narrowing impulse to “save the world.”\n\nResidencies combine both an activating frame of collective practices with the space for you to continue your daily work – a key aspect is learning how we can integrate community and practice, collective and private, absolute and relative in our daily life.\n\n## The Praxis Lab \n\nThe Bergerac Hub is a space where individuals can come together to explore, practice, and embody new ways of being and relating to each other and the world. We see this space as a place for **experimentation, exploration, and learning,** where people can engage in self-work, creative work, and spiritual practices within a supportive and structured framework. We believe that this framework, which combines elements of monastic and secular practices, can facilitate the development of a new paradigm of living and being, one that is more connected, embodied, and expansive. \n\nWe envision this space as a laboratory for systemic transformation, where we can document and study the effects of our practices on individual and collective well-being, and explore the potential of these practices to shape the future of society. Our ultimate goal is to create a model for a metamodern, evolutionary way of living that is grounded in the values of interdependence, mindfulness, and compassion, and that has the potential to awaken and activate the full potential of individuals and communities.\n\nFor this purpose, the Praxis Lab will serve as a research space to collect data on the relations between spaces, structures, and practices, and make visible their emotional, spiritual, and intellectual effects. The Praxis Lab team will conduct scientific observations during residencies to document and define the inter-relational human technology that fosters a new way of engaging with the world. The focus is on documenting practices from a \"how\" perspective, studying how human technology can animate forgotten skills of creativity and adjustment. The team will investigate questions such as: what is required to act from a space beyond thinking, what inner movement does this activate, and what are the effects of this posture? They will also explore the concept of a space as a place of practice and how to document self-research in a reproducible way. \n\nUltimately, the research conducted at the Praxis Lab at the Bergerac Hub aims to not only improve the well-being of individuals and communities, but also to contribute to the development of a more interconnected, compassionate and mindful society. Through documenting and studying the effects of our practices, we hope to inform and inspire others to create similar spaces and practices that can lead to systemic transformation.\n\n## Common Principles\n\n* **Engagement**  in daily collective practices: meditating, caring for the food and the house, and relating. \n* **Punctuality** so as not to encroach on the time of others. \n* **Benevolent food:** collective meals at the Praxis Hub are benevolent and plant-based, with the intention of fostering a different posture towards food. However, we invite each group to explore the complexity of their needs and make decisions collectively. \n* **Self responsibility:** the hub is a laboratory for collective experimentation.  Personal needs should be honored as long as they do not disrupt the collective.\n* **Responsivity:** a relative capacity to meet the potential challenges that come with living together is valued. Support tools are available, but it should be noted that this is not a therapeutic space.\n* **Respect for inanimate beings:** we consider the praxis hub to be a living being \n* **Concentration:** to support a mindful spirit, a non-alcohol policy is suggested during weekdays.\n\n## About the Hub\n\nThe house is finely decorated with antique furniture and a rare view onto the Dordogne. It is situated just a few steps from the river itself, and a beautiful park in a quiet area. The space is one of a kind, and its atmospheric surroundings are the perfect setting for deep exploration.\n\n![](/assets/images/dordogne-view.jpg)\n\nThe gorgeous view of the Dordogne from just outside the house.\n\n![](/assets/images/20200717_072527-800x1024.jpg)\n\nThe view of the Hub from the garden.\n\n### Common Spaces\n\nThe main house has a large dining room, a spacious kitchen, a spectacular living room, a separate sitting room with open fire, a gorgeous shared garden and good parking access.\n\n![](/assets/images/f30dcd17-9101-4a3a-b8c6-20eea8005010-1024x768.jpeg)\n\n**Dining Room** - complete with gorgeous antique furnishings, capable of comfortable seating over 20 guests.\n\n![](/assets/images/fdb8a1b5-8529-44a4-ad49-aa964f67b943-1024x768.jpeg)\n\n**Painting Room** (large living room) - suitable for group meditation, workshops and other activities.\n\n![](/assets/images/31c1bbd4-ec30-4c39-9eb2-ccbc7e5ebcce-1024x768.jpeg)\n\n**Fire Room** - cozy and atmospheric, with a working fire place.\n\n![](/assets/images/00278ba4-3e4a-4859-a97a-1fd2a80af860-768x1024.jpeg)\n\n**Garden** - sunny and full of beautiful plant life.\n\n### Image Gallery\n\n- [![](/assets/images/img_4207.jpg)](https://artearthtech.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/img_4207.jpg?w=580)\n    \n- [![](/assets/images/120293991_422919502013789_8779086897098183970_n.jpg)](https://artearthtech.files.wordpress.com/2020/09/120293991_422919502013789_8779086897098183970_n.jpg?w=682)\n    \n- [![](/assets/images/dsc01698_smaller-1.jpg)](https://lifeitself.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/dsc01698_smaller-1.jpg)\n    \n- [![](/assets/images/4bbf90d3-28a6-46bd-a2c9-de40b2bf7238-768x1024.jpeg)](https://lifeitself.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/4bbf90d3-28a6-46bd-a2c9-de40b2bf7238-768x1024.jpeg)\n        \n- [![](/assets/images/52bef2df-b245-4e2b-aecd-716320f35edb-1024x768.jpeg)](https://lifeitself.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/52bef2df-b245-4e2b-aecd-716320f35edb.jpeg)\n        \n- [![](/assets/images/372bae83-cf59-4ac6-b6fd-19105c3c5075-768x1024.jpeg)](https://lifeitself.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/372bae83-cf59-4ac6-b6fd-19105c3c5075.jpeg)\n    \n- [![](/assets/images/0552db0f-14a7-43e8-a7e5-80ec73e632a6-1024x768.jpeg)](https://lifeitself.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/0552db0f-14a7-43e8-a7e5-80ec73e632a6.jpeg)\n    \n- [![](/assets/images/631e960b-b9ba-41ce-b0da-5b2db3a860f0.jpeg)](https://lifeitself.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/631e960b-b9ba-41ce-b0da-5b2db3a860f0.jpeg)\n    \n- [![](/assets/images/44416ad1-588d-4076-9519-08157a3652ef-1024x768.jpeg)](https://lifeitself.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/44416ad1-588d-4076-9519-08157a3652ef.jpeg)\n    \n- [![](/assets/images/91380fe3-bf2c-4223-a23b-9b7479669d90-768x1024.jpeg)](https://lifeitself.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/91380fe3-bf2c-4223-a23b-9b7479669d90.jpeg)\n    \n- [![](/assets/images/a1b43948-e034-4c8c-b769-7fde512c31d7-768x1024.jpeg)](https://lifeitself.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/a1b43948-e034-4c8c-b769-7fde512c31d7.jpeg)\n    \n- [![](/assets/images/a4aae6fe-0c9b-4884-888a-cc10d1ce5cf3-1024x768.jpeg)](https://lifeitself.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/a4aae6fe-0c9b-4884-888a-cc10d1ce5cf3.jpeg)\n            \n\n### Bedrooms\n\nThere are three types of bedroom: basic, standard, premium.
