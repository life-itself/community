Create a folder for the Onboardee in [Life Itself - People / HR/Contracts](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pQNPDqDV4kJ95V1bgP8QgwoGJ1mavAnF)).\n2. Create a draft contract:\n    1. Copy the template contract which is stored [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1pdh9lXpMXib3Uxan0i7F5qe2H8UKKHw4).\n    2. Move it to the Person's folder you created in Step 1.\n    3. Rename it to `{Contractor Name} Life Itself Contract {Year}`.\n    4. Fill in any relevant sections, especially the key terms in the Schedule section.\n    5. Highlight everything that needs to be filled out by the Onboardee.\n\n### Contractor Reviews\n\n1. In Google Docs click Share and share with the contractor's personal email.\n    * Make sure to tick \"Skip sending notification\" as you will notify them by email in the next step.\n2. Email the contractor with the email below (**cc** ops@lifeitself.us).\n\n    Subject: Your Life Itself Contract: Please Review and Complete\n\n    ```\n    Hello XXX,\n\n    Welcome! This is your contract:\n\n    {Insert Link to Google Doc}\n\n    Please review and fill in any relevant highlighted sections. If you have any questions please note these as comments in the doc. Then:\n\n    EITHER: you have questions. If so, please email us to let us know so we can get those resolved 😀\n\n    OR: it all looks good and you have no questions. Please then sign (insert your signature and date) and email us to let us know. We will then sign and send you a copy.\n\n    Many thanks,\n\n    XXX\n    ```\n\n### Email Contract\n\nOnce both parties have signed we:\n\n* Review the contract and remove the highlighted parts.\n* Make a PDF of the contract.\n* Store that in Drive in the contract folder for that contractor.\n* Email the PDF of the signed contract to the contractor for their records **cc**'ing ops@lifeitself.us.\n\n## Setup on Systems\n\n:::warning\nThese steps can be done in parallel or out of order.\n\nHowever, unless otherwise agreed, we should only do these steps **once there is a signed contract**.\n:::\n\n1. **GSuite Account and Email:** Create the Onboardee's email account as firstname@lifeitself.us (or firstname.lastname@lifeitself.us if necessary) on the Google Admin page and ensure the log-in details are sent to the Onboardee's personal email address. \n\n2. **Create accounts / send invitations** on systems where they can't create themselves\n\n    * To add the Onboardee to Xero [see Xero access](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bY7za2nRTN-shUDYQkW3_pjSP6G0RiEFiT5kpEOgY44/edit#heading=h.v59x2fkuxkjt) and add their bank account details once received.\n    \n3. **Welcome Call Invitation**: Send them an invitation for a Welcome Call within the next days.\n\n4. **Welcome email:** Send them the welcome email to their Life Itself email.\n\n    Subject: Welcome to Life Itself -- next steps in getting you set up\n\n    ```\n    Hi {XXX},\n\n    Welcome to Life Itself. This is the beginning of an amazing journey! 🚀 👩‍🚀\n\n    **1. Start Setting Yourself Up!**\n\n    Please start getting yourself set up here:\n\n    https://tao.lifeitself.us/onboarding/\n\n    **Please complete as much of the Onboarding Guide as possible before your Welcome Call, making note of any questions you have**. Doing this allows us to grant you access to all systems and makes the the onboarding process super-smooth.\n\t\n    **2. Welcome call**\n\n    A welcome call has been scheduled and you will have received an invitation by email. Please accept the invite. 😊\n\n    If you are **unable** to make that time please let us know asap by declining the invite and suggesting an alternative time!\n\n    Looking to having you on board!\n  \n    Best,\n\n    ...\n    ```\n\n## Welcome Call\n\nHere is the suggested agenda for the Welcome Call with the new team member. It should usually take no more than an hour.\n\n:::tip\nThe Onboarder should capture questions during the onboarding meeting and forward any questions they can't answer to other team members.\n:::\n\n**Welcome**\n\n* Introduce yourself **[5m]**\n* Ask them to intro themselves **[5m]**\n\n**What this call is about -- intro to onboarding and company context**\n\n* We’ve designed the onboarding process to be a self-service one but I’m just going to say a few words to intro you to the company.\n* Overview of Life Itself.\n  * What we do.\n  * Team is global and fully remote, with team members in Germany, France and the UK.\n  * Flat, self-organizing self-managing organisational set-up [very brief but this even informs the nature of this onboarding process!]\n* Who they will be working with\n* Talk about Values & Culture briefly, as our emphasis on culture is an important and distinctive part of our approach.\n  * Why that’s important to us.\n  * Example: Integrity.\n* Does the Onboardee have any questions about culture not answered in the Tao?\n\n**Onboarding**\n\nThe Onboarder should have completed most of the [Onboarding Guide](/onboarding/).\n\n* Check that they have done steps and whether they have any blockers or questions **[15m]**\n* Introduce the Onboardee to how we manage our website on Wordpress and answer any questions they have about our other systems, such as GitHub. Show them around the All-Team Google drive and ensure they know the location of key documents, such as those relating to accounts.\n","code":"var Component=(()=>{var c=Object.create;var t=Object.defineProperty;var m=Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor;var p=Object.getOwnPropertyNames;var u=Object.getPrototypeOf,g=Object.prototype.hasOwnProperty;var b=(a,e)=>()=>(e||a((e={exports:{}}).exports,e),e.exports),f=(a,e)=>{for(var l in e)t(a,l,{get:e[l],enumerable:!0})},s=(a,e,l,o)=>{if(e&&typeof e==\"object\"||typeof e==\"function\")for(let i of p(e))!g.call(a,i)&&i!==l&&t(a,i,{get:()=>e[i],enumerable:!(o=m(e,i))||o.enumerable});return a};var w=(a,e,l)=>(l=a!=null?c(u(a)):{},s(e||!a||!a.__esModule?t(l,\"default\",{value:a,enumerable:!0}):l,a)),v=a=>s(t({},\"__esModule\",{value:!0}),a);var d=b((x,r)=>{r.exports=_jsx_runtime});var L={};f(L,{default:()=>N});var n=w(d());function h(a){let e=Object.assign({h1:\"h1\",h2:\"h2\",a:\"a\",svg:\"svg\",path:\"path\",p:\"p\",ul:\"ul\",li:\"li\",strong:\"strong\",mermaid:\"mermaid\",code:\"code\",pre:\"pre\",span:\"span\",h3:\"h3\",ol:\"ol\"},a.components);return(0,n.jsxs)(n.Fragment,{children:[(0,n.jsx)(e.h1,{id:\"onboarding-a-new-team-member\",children:\"Onboarding A New Team Member\"}),`\n`,(0,n.jsxs)(e.h2,{id:\"principles\",children:[(0,n.jsx)(e.a,{\"aria-hidden\":\"true\",tabIndex:\"-1\",href:\"#principles\",children:(0,n.jsx)(e.svg,{xmlns:\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\",fill:\"#ab2b65\",viewBox:\"0 0 20 20\",className:\"w-5 h-5\",children:(0,n.jsx)(e.path,{fillRule:\"evenodd\",clipRule:\"evenodd\",d:\"M9.493 2.853a.75.75 0 00-1.486-.205L7.545 6H4.198a.75.75 0 000 1.5h3.14l-.69 5H3.302a.75.75 0 000 1.5h3.14l-.435 3.148a.75.75 0 001.486.205L7.955 14h2.986l-.434 3.148a.75.75 0 001.486.205L12.456 14h3.346a.75.75 0 000-1.5h-3.14l.69-5h3.346a.75.75 0 000-1.5h-3.14l.435-3.147a.75.75 0 00-1.486-.205L12.045 6H9.059l.434-3.147zM8.852 7.5l-.69 5h2.986l.69-5H8.852z\"})})}),\"Principles\"]}),`\n`,(0,n.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"The onboarding process has been designed to be lean and simple.\"}),`\n`,(0,n.jsx)(e.p,{children:\"A member of the Ops team will produce a contract and initiate the onboarding process.
