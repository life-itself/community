Sprints are an opportunity to take time away from your everyday engagements to reflect and focus on a project of your choice surrounded by an amazing community in an incredible environment.

The sprints take place at our [Bergerac Hubs](https://lifeitself.org/bergerac/), a stunning Townhouse in the medieval city of Bergerac, and a peaceful Farmhouse not far away, a short drive from Plum Village.

Amongst the participants youâ€™ll have access to experts in a variety of fields: digital technology, user experience, cognitive science, biodiversity and ecology as well as artists and performers.
