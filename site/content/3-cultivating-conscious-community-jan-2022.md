## Overview

More and more groups are interested in creating spaces for personal and collective growth.

But, how do we do this? What are the practices, what are the structures? At present, there is a lack of systematic shared knowledge in this area. Moreover, this knowledge is for the most part embodied – it must be practiced not simply read or talked about. Furthermore, these competencies are best learned (and sometimes only learned) through actual experience and practice in the collective.  

This month-long residency is an opportunity for those interested in creating or participating in growth-oriented collectives both to explore and to embody related practices and patterns.

**Explore**: share, discuss and pattern the various practices and approaches in this area. 

**Embody**: the residency is also a real-life pilot of them in this micro-collective

Some of the essential practices we will explore and trial include:

- Creating Welcoming Spaces
- Self-Connection and Self-Compassion
- Empathic Listening
- Authentic Self-Expression
- Facilitating Conflict and Mediating Polarization
- Collaborative Decision-Making
- Consciously Engaging Power and Privilege
- Giving and Receiving Conscious Feedback
- Cultivating Collective Wisdom
- Whole-Person and Whole-System Awareness

## Workshop: 4 Jan to 9 Jan 2022

**The residency will commence with a 5d intensive workshop** on core practices to cultivate inner well-being and thriving interdependent relationships and communities. It is both a setup for the residency’s self-practice and demonstrator of the practices we are seeking to explore.

_You can register to only attend the workshop._

**4 January Arrival:** We invite people to arrive on the 4th so that we can be settled and ready to begin together on the morning of 5th.

**5-9 January Workshop:** On these five days Karl will lead a training to cultivate inner well-being and thriving interdependent relationships and communities.

This training is a heart- and consciousness-expanding experience that integrates core personal and interpersonal practices such as:

- Self-connection, parts and self awareness
- Empathic listening
- Recovering from reactivity
- Making clear requests
- Consciousness of power and privilege
- Transforming enemy images
- Collaborative decision-making
- Giving and receiving life-enriching feedback, and more.

The workshop has been developed through decades of organisational and community development and experimentation, as well as study with Dr. Richard Schwartz (Internal Family Systems therapy), Dr. Marshall Rosenberg (Nonviolent Communication), Thomas Hübl (Collective Trauma Healing), and Thich Nhat Hahn (Order of Interbeing).

Some may already have a background in some or all of these practices, and that in some cases you might even be leading training in these practices yourself. If this is the case, we invite your support for the work by being test participants and by giving your valuable feedback and suggestions regarding the training.

### Testimonials

> _This experience truly opened my heart. It made me feel what compassion is, beyond conceptual knowing. Karl leads by example, inviting a level of depth and openness that I hadn’t experienced in a group before. It was so enriching to learn together how to transform restrictive habits into openness, and how to improve the quality of our daily-life interactions. I leave the course with insights and tools that will help me to keep growing as a human being. This is so much needed in the times we live in._
> 
> _This is a training in self-leadership – the ability to stay close to yourself and engage with the world around you from an open mind and an open heart, so that you are more able to actually be the change you want to see in the world._

## Part of the Sympoiesis Series

Sympoiesis #3 is the third in the series of month-long residencies that are a spiritual cooking-together of various ingredients: people, practices, workshops, art, community life and actual cooking. The ingredients are drawn by the opening of a space, a vacuum to be filled by people and practices too spiritual for politics, too “political” for the monasteries. The idea that life can be divorced from spirit is at the heart of our trouble. Let’s sit with this great trouble without giving into the narrowing impulse to “save the world.”

Residencies combine both an activating frame of collective practices and a time space dedicated for writing on C.A , on a specific project or/ and daily work – A key aspect is learning how we can integrate community and practice, collective and private, absolute and relative in our daily life. 

## **STRUCTURE**

Life itself residencies are based on a daily structure in order to create a container in which the collective body can move together and sustains each participant . This is the question of what we call the Minimum Lovable Product , what is the structure sufficiently strong to hold us as a community and sufficiently flexible to integrate our individualism? those residencies are directly inspired by the monastic zen communities adapted to our secular reality, a laboratory for mettamodern communities.

Here is a proposal that curators will adapt freely with their group :

- 7h30: sitting in silence 30 mn ( Zazen)
- 8h00: free breakfast
- 8h45: rôles for the day
- 9h00 collective cooking , cleaning and gardening practice ( 1h00)
- 10h00 : collective sessions or personnel work
- 13h00: lunch at table alternate with informal buffet style
- collective sessions or personal work in afternoon
- 19h00: 3 mn share by pair
- 19h15: just sitting or other meditation 30 mn
- informal diner
- 20h30 : evening practices ( 1h30)

No planning on week ends. No evening practices on Wednesdays

## FAQs

See also the overall FAQs for all the residencies.

### Can I do my normal work during this residency? (Yes)

The initial 5-day workshop will be full time, but after that you can self-work. Of course, we imagine that many participants are coming specifically to work and collaborate around the subject matter of the residency.

### Can I come for part of the month?

Yes, though we prioritize those able to spend the whole month. If coming partially we also prefer that you attend the first part of the residency that includes the workshop.
