## Key Info

### What is it?

A 2-week residency consisting of intensive small-group and whole-group workshops, discussions and experiential sessions. We will create as safe a container as possible to enable the emergence of relational insights and attachment resiliency. The immersion format allows for insights from structured experiential sessions to be integrated in relationships during the residency itself. There will be plenty of Open Spaces for residents to  learn, practice and share skills with one another.  The residency includes time and space for you to continue your daily personal work and projects (35-40h/week). 

Note: People must be able to attend all daily structured sessions (about 1.5h/day) and a daily period of collective care (1h/day) in order to be accepted in the residency.

### **Why?**

The quality of our relationships accounts among the most important factors for both physical and mental health. In school we did not learn how to build strong relationships, how to repair a connection when a rupture occurred, or how to express our needs for safety and emotional support. This residency aims to strengthen our way of engaging in relationships so that we can feel freer to be ourselves with others, and build strong bonds.

- **Regulate:** We will learn to _co-regulate_, which means we learn to support one another to feel better together. We learn to feel better somatically (in our body), emotionally (feeling well-being), cognitively (experiencing more meaning in life) and socially (feeling more embedded with others).
- **Restore:** From this sense of connection, our patterns of dysregulation and dissociation can soften and be released. 
- **Respond:** As we grow our nervous system capacity and relational skills, we have more space and possibility for new ways of engaging with the world.

The conceptual framework for group sessions stems of psychodynamic and attachment theories as well as social and positive psychology. The NeuroSystemics methodology specifically includes nervous system science to support relational resiliency. We emphasize “_neuroceptive safety_” which means we specifically attempt to modulate the containment of the group to skilfully face the challenges emerging, and embody the resources developed. For example, we start with a short embodiment practice at the beginning of the session to prime for somatic sensitivity and speaking from a place of experience. As the group builds in its quality of compassion, mutual support and enjoyment, it become a womb-like experience which enables a deep nervous system regulation for the group as a whole.
