We are experts in decentralised governance systems, including Holacracy. We can support your organisation to make a full transition to decentralised governance, or help you selectively use its approaches to harness the collective intelligence of your team.

Our associates can also help to redesign and improve the full range of HR and operational processes, from hiring and compensation setting to CPD and well-being support.

##### Strategy and learning

Our unique approach to strategy development draws on participatory approaches such as deliberative democracy, ensuring your strategy will be relevant and applicable to the everyday realities of your organisation.

We can also operate as a learning partner at both the organisational and project based level, and support the design and implementation of knowledge management systems.

##### Facilitation, culture and coaching

We can also bring our extensive experience in community building to bear on your organisation, undertaking a range of cultural development and teambuilding activities to support cohesion and collaboration.
