## **Question: How can collective practices in everyday life nourish a way of being-withness in the world?**

![](assets/images/20210402_082033-768x1024.jpg)

# **Introduction**

Sympoiesis #1 is the first in the series of month-long residencies that are a spiritual cooking-together of various ingredients: people, practices, workshops, art, community life and actual cooking. The ingredients are drawn by the opening of a space, a vacuum to be filled by people and practices too spiritual for politics, too “political” for the monasteries. The idea that life can be divorced from spirit is at the heart of our trouble. Let’s sit with this great trouble without giving into the narrowing impulse to “save the world.”

Residencies combine both an activating frame of collective practices with the space for you to continue your daily work – a key aspect is learning how we can integrate community and practice, collective and private, absolute and relative in our daily life. You can read more about Sympoiesis residencies here [https://lifeitself.org/sympoiesis/](https://lifeitself.org/sympoiesis/)

## Sympoiesis #1 /Conscious collective Practices

**The experiment** : for one month, a group of residents and guests (during retreats) will experience a way of living directly inspired by the daily practices of Zen temples. Each day will be punctuated by zazen, vegetable cutting, meal preparation, meals and deep listening circles. The idea here is to find the balance between the practices necessary to create a collective body that supports individual inspiration. During this month, two retreats will be offered: a formal Zen retreat and a retreat focused on food.

The exploration of the retreat is to experiment a collective codesign for our routine within a strong trust engagement that it is through the body collective movement that we can individually awake to new energy, thoughts and simply joy.

**Conscious food :** we will have a particular attention on how and what do we eat as a transformational experience. We will see how we can integrate zen temple food ( Shojin cuisine) to relate differently to food and the world in our secular life.

## Schedule

- (7h30 to 8h00 am  body awakening )

During retreats Participants will experience more deeply the collective body of the world moving together within, the power of beingwithness via contemplation (zazen, food, cleaning etc)_

# **Common principles** 

We are a Lab of practices and want to experience the effect of the collective body on ourselves and how it feeds back the collective. In order to do that we believe basics have to be agreed on previously to the reunion. Those commitments are a mix of common sense behaviors when we live together and as a residency, specific requirements to giving back the fruits of your experience at the Praxis Hub.

- to commit not to bring animal flesh products into the Hub in order to create a sanctuary and honor the sacrifice of all the lives taken for our food today
- to commit to follow a daily collective schedule and community work
- to commit to participate in retreats/workshops during residency
- to commit to live no trace in kitchen , bathrooms , toilets after personal use 
- to commit to put back zafu and zabutons in order manner after use 
- to commit to not use alcohol during the week e in the Hub ( we can go outside), week ends are OK for party.
- to commit to clean one's room fully before departure
- to commit to answer a questionnaire before entering the hub and write a feedback after the experience related to daily collective practices, food and facilitation.

As the food is at the heart of both joy and pain of our world we will explore what does it mean to have enough, what is really nourishing us and as we will cook together we will learn the way of the Tenzo and how to compose  seasonal menus as  a way to “bewith” the world.

Valerie Dai Hatsu  has been practicing the shojin ryori ( zen cooking) in zen  monastic temples in Japan for 10 years  and  carries the enthusiasm to share it  in the secular world. More info on her website : [http://lacuisinedelabienveillance.org](http://lacuisinedelabienveillance.org)

We will also practice meals with  Oryoki ( 3 bowls) and link ourselves to the past and futur with our food.
