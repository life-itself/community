In August 2020, we began the transformation of an underloved farmhouse into a bustling community hub in the beautiful south of France. Moments from the acclaimed Buddhist monastery Plum Village, our Bergerac hub will become a home for the community, complete with accommodation, event space, and garden. The Build Festival was the first step!

Want to hear more about what we got up to during the Festival? Read our [blog](https://lifeitself.org/2020/09/10/more-than-just-bricks-and-mortar-bergerac-build-festival-2020/) reflecting on the amazing month.

Given the success of our pilot in 2020 we are hoping to run another event in the summer of 2021. You can sign up to our mailing list below to be notified as soon as we have more information:
