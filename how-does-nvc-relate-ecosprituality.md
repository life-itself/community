# How does non-violent communication relate to eco spirituality?

[[notes/nvc|Nonviolent Communication (NVC)]] is named after Gandhi's use of the word "ahimsa" or "nonviolence" to describe a consciousness of compassion toward ourselves, others, and all life.

It offers a practical framework to support people to connect to the deeper essence of what is important to us, others, and all living beings.

To give one practical example, it help people to distinguish the difference between our habitual strategies (working hard to make money, buying more stuff, driving a car, criticizing ourselves, getting caught in arguments with others, blaming and having enemy images about politicians, etc) and our true needs underlying these strategies (freedom, transportation, self-worth, love, belonging, connection, to be seen and heard, safety, etc).

This liberates people to explore the many more life-enriching strategies for meeting their needs. Another example is that NVC helps people understand their own and other people's feelings and needs more deeply, supporting us to empathically listen to those who have different views than us (say, a fossil fuel industry executive, politician, police officer, friend, family member, etc), which has been scientifically proven to be far more effective in changing people's views than presenting them with rational or scientific arguments for changing their minds.

These are a couple examples, but there are many more.

Nonviolent Communication, when integrated and embodied, supports change-makers of all kinds (teachers, activists doctors, etc) to translate interdependence into action. That is, to take action, have conversations, make decisions, and make a difference in ways that radically honor the needs of all life.
