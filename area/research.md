# Community Research Initiative

Sep 2016 to present.

## Why do research?

- To set out “What is to be done / What is doable?”
    - What is our vision of the future that *we* want to see — and how
      do they fit together
    - What actions do we want take
    - Why Art / Earth / Tech
- Create policies and recommendations e.g. in governance, in politics,
  in technology
- Answer specific questions we have - without it coming under a bigger
  theme
- Have a shared understanding within Art / Earth / Tech
- To do collaborative research and get experience of doing them
  without the normal incentive structures
- Answer practical questions e.g. what practical challenges are there
  to doing what we would like or what business model could we have?
    - This would likely come under other activities e.g. the working
      group looking at material sustainability would research
      business models

## Criteria

- Relate to why we do this
- Interesting to those who are going to contribute …
- Not too hard
    - Will not take years to get anywhere
        - we may do big multi-year research at some point however
          probably would do that in its own working group
        - Will not require very deep specialist knowledge (e.g.
          quantum physics)
- Accessible - others can join in, others outside of Art / Earth /
  Tech could be interested
- Replicable - others can follow our findings and “repeat” them in
  appropriate manner

## Guidelines for Primers

- What are we trying to achieve with the primer items? Ans: **Have a
  shared understanding within AET group and community**
    - No need for originality - we can copy and paste from wikipedia!
    - They can be opinionated
    - Establish common ground
- Audience
    - Who is going to read it? AET community and the research group.
    - What prior knowledge is expected
        - Of the broader AET research effort: non especially
        - May be useful to understand these are part of AET
          research effort but not essential
        - Of the specific topic: can vary. Usually assume very little.
          On technical topics is fine to state pre-requisites e.g.
          please go and read this and this
- Length: 1-5 pages.
    - 1 page is great! 1 page exec summary if more than 2 pages.
    - + further reading / references
- Style: friendly, succinct, informative, not too academic.

    - **Education. Where has a great educational system? What do we know about good education? (3.6) {7.6}
    - Wise metrics. Build a dashboard showing performance of countries or areas on our wise metrics (e.g. wisest city in the US, wisest country in the world). Pick metrics, collect data, build a dashboard. (6) {8.6}**
        - Reason from Stefan: in long run not that important, but in short run very important.
    -   Scaling a social system such as a corporation, organization or a community. What is optimal size. Often think scaling is about making one thing bigger. But maybe about point where you split. (5.3) {3.6}
        - Connection: org structures
    -   _**Open information - openness as the economic policy question and solution of the information age. How much do we spend on IT a year in gov and generally. How much on content? How could we fund this differently? And what would be the numbers. (2.3) {7.6}**_
-   What’s not working and how do we address it- specific examples (more granular than wise society and connected with it)
    -   **[Evidence on addictive / distracting tech (and best ways to address) e.g. TV, facebook etc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PvdLV-PzAMH3lLdAfaRcsa5N3pBZMCpaofYFFlPj46s/edit) (3.3) {8} (Liam)**

        - Reading list: Joel Cohen, Vaclav Smil
    -   **What is _actually_ happening re climate change. What is situation with CO2 and what warming has happened. Examples of impact already / very likely to happen. (4.3) {4}**
        - What actions should we take on climate change. What is a plausible renewable energy policy for the world
    -   Food production. Intensive vs organic etc. What are alternative ways of producing foods vs intensive agriculture - how efficient are they. What are the benefits? (4.5) {4.3}
    - **The Culture of Individualistic Capitalism. Impact on people of consumerism, competition, individualism, inequality. (5) {8.6}**
        - Daniel Bell: cultural contradictions of capitalism

    -   Non-attachment to views and how and why people change their minds
    - Discrimination and Universalism: racism, sexism and their opposites (Sylvie). What is so? Where does it arise
        - Link to group dynamics

    - Wellness …. (individually and socially. vs growth etc)
    - Wisdom - reuse liam’s reflections from gathering (?)
    - **[Memes. What is a meme? Why are they important for our work](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Gi4EGft8fvvFfvpo8RAgIeer3XjhL0fP57OsBMnr2Is/edit) (1.3) {8} (Stefan)**
    - **[Mind-fulness, Meditation and relevant philosophies e.g. Daoism, Buddhism](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14mJmmLYmaqLY5aoX1dFskHsbVL5SkXcXWSWsfoqq_-Y/edit) (1.6) {11.3} (Rufus + (Liam))**
