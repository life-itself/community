# Kibbutz Research

Kibbutz were socialist communitarian / communal settlements in Israel. Uusally based on equal sharing of income and communal ownership of property.

Lot of good economic research by Abramitzky:

  * Excellent summary presentation: [http://eml.berkeley.edu//\~saez/course/Abramitzky\_book\_presentation.pdf](http://eml.berkeley.edu//~saez/course/Abramitzky_book_presentation.pdf)

One nice excerpt from JEH article (summary of his dissertation):

> If insurance is valuable and the sharing-rule can be adjusted to mitigate brain-drain, then why is not the entire world a Kibbutz? And, why are all Kibbutzim relatively small? One answer is that social ties between members are important in mitigating the moral hazard problem and facilitating insurance. Interestingly, membership size does not affect a Kibbutz’s likelihood to shift away from equal-sharing. At a first glance, this finding may suggest that the shirking problem is not a driving force in Kibbutzim’s commitment to equal-sharing; otherwise, larger Kibbutzim, where monitoring is more difficult, would be more likely to shift away from equal-sharing. However, all Kibbutzim have fewer than 1,200 members, so they may be equally effective in monitoring and in mitigating the shirking problem. The lack of privacy that is a by-product of the monitoring may explain why not everyone wishes to live in a Kibbutz.
