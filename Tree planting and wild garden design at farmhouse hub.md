# Tree planting and wild garden design at farmhouse hub

🌲 Seeking advice on tree planting and wild garden design esp from permaculture perspective.🪴 🌳

Hi all, we are looking to do some tree planting and wild garden at the Life Itself farmhouse hub this autumn and looking for courses / books / videos / guidance that would be relevant especially on the permaculture front.

Any suggestions are warmly welcome.

Also can provide a “fly through” of the site if of interest smile

## Suggestions

### From Liana

Hi Rufus 🙏🏼 Applewood Permaculture in the UK offer high quality courses in both on the ground permaculture design, and social permaculture (cultural energence) for us humans https://applewoodcourses.com

Also global thought leader and permaculture guru, Morag Gamble, in Australia offers multiple courses (and much more) through the Permaculture Education Institute in Australia https://permacultureeducationinstitute.org. Both of these organisations would be amazing to plug into and could possibly be wonderful people for the greater Life Itself/Second Renaissance community to do some sharings/partnering with…

### From Lucy

Permaculture for me is a design system for existing on the planet in a way that puts humans in harmony with the wider living system.  Producing as well as consuming, living in balance, using all parts of the system (edges, waste etc). On the face of it yes, it’s a guide to food production, but when you look deeper, for example when we consider how life would be if we ‘humaned’ according to the twelve permaculture principles (ie. applying to all life, not just food growing), then this gives us a window into a possible operating system for thriveable life on this planet.

I studied my permaculture certificate with Bill Mollison, I have many notes and resources, let’s chat permaculture over a cuppa 🌱
