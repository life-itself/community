## What is Deep Democracy

From https://www.deepdemocracyintensive.com

> Deep Democracy (also called Process Work)
> 
> It is a global, whole system approach to facilitate change, self-realization and self-discovery for individuals, families, teams, organizations, and governments. 
> 
> It is a new paradigm developed by [Arnold Mindell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnold_Mindell) that brings out the deepest selves of individuals, the underlying spirits of teams and organizations, and the invisible unity that is present in the midst of diversity, conflict, and strife. 
> 
> It can also be considered a project in developing urban shamanism. 
> 
> It can be used to coach individuals, facilitate teams and organizations, and lead and support national and international processes across communities and borders. 
> 
> It is a community building approach and a conflict resolution model that works with the entirety of information that is present within a system – and it is more than that. 
> 
> It is a scientific model that integrates perspectives from physics, psychology, and complexity science.
