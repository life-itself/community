## [[notes/projects/life-itself-v3]]

Made two important choices re [[notes/projects/life-itself-v3]]

- Go for School of Life onto-flavored
- "Conscious coliving and communities" for initial campaign

### Go for School of Life onto-flavored

- It is more attractive to more people (vs e.g. lay awakening)
- It obviously is part of creating a "wiser, weller world"
- Yet it is a natural "one-level down" (i.e. more specific) - and we want more specific
- Whilst broader than other options it is still distinctive and specific
- other items nest naturally within it e.g. critical point relates to transforming society, lay awakening is for people to think/realize that off-the-charts happiness can come from awakening ...
- we can focus down for initial campaigns and effort

### Conscious coliving and communities for initial campaign

- Conscious coliving is distinctive and builds on several existing domains/tends
  - conscious coliving means: living in together/"community" (loose or formal) *and* and active inner development and collective practices [and awareness of impact on other's and the planet]
  - coliving
  - ecovillages
  - intentional communities
  - mindfulness and spirituality
  - loneliness and community
- Having a single, more specific topic is a good idea
  - brings focus and clarity for team
  - ditto for wider audience
- This is a good topic
  - Topic is concrete, "real" and important
    - important as relates to something important in people's live (where, how and with whom i live)
  - There is an audience for conscious coliving
    - Interest and lessons across the spectrum: from hard-core intentional community to a student shared house 
    - ic.org and other sites show continued interest in intentional community
    - Growing interest in mindfulness, spirituality etc add that dimension
  - Topic is attractive
    - Personal is stronger than societal
    - Clear audience interested in conscious coliving (witness applications)
    - Topic is of interest to our core audience
      - e.g. people have come to coliving stuff
      - coliving connects with community more generally and even with ecology (e.g. ecovillages) which were 2 highly mentioned topics in survey
  - Topic Personal is distintive in "our space" (to an extent)
  - topic connects both "down" and "up" to key ideas
    - "down" to e.g. integral multi-dim stage theory
    - "up" to societal transformation e.g. we need to learn to live/work together (culturally, ecologically etc)
- We can "execute"
  - We have relevant experience, knowledge and practical expertise
    - Have run hubs for 5y
    - Have researched coliving projects for 20y with 5-10y of intensive effort
  - We have existing content and can imagine good new content (see below)
  - We have capacity on marketing etc
- Concrete application of the "big ideas" (e.g. stage theory, spirituality etc)
- Connects with and has synergires with other activities Life Itself is doing
  - Connects with Praxis Hub
    - Attracting people to come to residencies
    - Can learn from residencies
  - Connects with research interest of team
    - Marc and Liubov explicitly interested
    - Rufus interested
- Advances/explores key areas of our larger strategic objective of a wiser, weller world
  - (we believe) Coliving as a practice likely plays a key role in deeper transformation personally and collectively
- We can make this financially sustainable
  - We can create masterclasses (e.g. we know experts like Rich B, Karl etc)
  - Coliving Counselling (shared housing therapy)
