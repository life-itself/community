#todo/process

* Context: re [[abc/Jordan Hall]] conversation and [[GameA]] came up
* ðŸ’¡ [[GameA]] = dominant paradigm/culture (in Life Itself terminology) = some admixture of amber/orange/green in spiral/wilber
* ðŸ’¡ would be generally useful to do a terminology mapping from the different communities (a kind of Metamodern Dictionary with translations) cf [[streams/ecosystem]]
